244,"thither caused to be conveyed Young Jackson in his sleep, and had there",CD

309,"was void. In passing back to get out of the station again, he learnt the cause of",CD

310,"this vacancy, by catching sight of Lamps on the opposite line of railway,",CD

311,"skipping along the top of a train, from carriage to carriage, and catching",CD

312,lighted namesakes thrown up to him by a coadjutor.,CD

313,"""He is busy. He has not much time for composing or singing Comic Songs",CD

314,"this morning, I take it.""",CD

315,"The direction he pursued now, was into the country, keeping very near to",CD

316,"the side of one great Line of railway, and within easy view of others. ""I have",CD

317,"half a mind,"" he said, glancing around, ""to settle the question from this point,",CD

318,"by saying, 'I'll take this set of rails, or that, or t'other, and stick to it.' They",CD

319,"separate themselves from the confusion, out here, and go their ways.""",CD

320,"Ascending a gentle hill of some extent, he came to a few cottages. There,",CD

321,looking about him as a very reserved man might who had never looked about,CD

322,"him in his life before, he saw some six or eight young children come merrily",CD

323,"trooping and whooping from one of the cottages, and disperse. But not until",CD

324,"they had all turned at the little garden gate, and kissed their hands to a face at",CD

325,"the upper window: a low window enough, although the upper, for the cottage",CD

326,had but a story of one room above the ground.,CD

327,"Now, that the children should do this was nothing; but that they should do",CD

328,"this to a face lying on the sill of the open window, turned towards them in a",CD

329,"horizontal position, and apparently only a face, was something noticeable. He",CD

330,looked up at the window again. Could only see a very fragile though a very,CD

331,"bright face, lying on one cheek on the window-sill. The delicate smiling face",CD

332,"of a girl or woman. Framed in long bright brown hair, round which was tied a",CD

333,"light blue band or fillet, passing under the chin.",CD

334,"He walked on, turned back, passed the window again, shyly glanced up",CD

335,again. No change. He struck off by a winding branch-road at the top of the hill,CD

336,"-which he must otherwise have descended-kept the cottages in view,",CD

337,worked his way round at a distance so as to come out once more into the main,CD

338,road and be obliged to pass the cottages again. The face still lay on the,CD

339,"window-sill, but not so much inclined towards him. And now there were a pair",CD

340,of delicate hands too. They had the action of performing on some musical,CD

341,"instrument, and yet it produced no sound that reached his ears.",CD

342,"""Mugby Junction must be the maddest place in England,"" said Barbox",CD

343,"Brothers, pursuing his way down the hill. ""The first thing I find here is a",CD

344,Railway Porter who composes comic songs to sing at his bedside. The second,CD

345,"thing I find here is a face, and a pair of hands playing a musical instrument",CD

346,"that don't play!""",CD

347,"The day was a fine bright day in the early beginning of November, the air",CD

348,"was clear and inspiriting, and the landscape was rich in beautiful colours. The",CD

349,"prevailing colours in the court off Lombard-street, London city, had been few",CD

350,"and sombre. Sometimes, when the weather elsewhere was very bright indeed,",CD

351,"the dwellers in those tents enjoyed a pepper-and-salt-coloured day or two, but",CD

352,"their atmosphere's usual wear was slate, or snuff colour.",CD

353,"He relished his walk so well, that he repeated it next day. He was a little",CD

354,"earlier at the cottage than on the day before, and he could hear the children upstairs singing to a regular measure and clapping out the time with their hands.",CD

355,"""Still, there is no sound of any musical instrument,"" he said, listening at",CD

356,"the corner, ""and yet I saw the performing hands again, as I came by. What are",CD

357,"the children singing? Why, good Lord, they can never be singing the",CD

358,"multiplication-table!""",CD

359,"They were though, and with infinite enjoyment. The mysterious face had a",CD

360,voice attached to it which occasionally led or set the children right. Its musical,CD

361,"cheerfulness was delightful. The measure at length stopped, and was",CD

362,"succeeded by a murmuring of young voices, and then by a short song which he",CD

363,"made out to be about the current month of the year, and about what work it",CD

364,"yielded to the labourers in the fields and farm-yards. Then, there was a stir of",CD

365,"little feet, and the children came trooping and whooping out, as on the",CD

366,"previous day. And again, as on the previous day, they all turned at the garden",CD

367,"gate, and kissed their hands-evidently to the face on the window-sill, though",CD

368,Barbox Brothers from his retired post of disadvantage at the corner could not,CD

369,see it.,CD

370,"But as the children dispersed, he cut off one small straggler-a brown",CD

371,faced boy with flaxen hair-and said to him:,CD

372,"""Come here, little one. Tell me whose house is that?""",CD

373,"The child, with one swarthy arm held up across his eyes, half in shyness,",CD

374,"and half ready for defence, said from behind the inside of his elbow:",CD

375,"""Phoebe's.""",CD

376,"""And who,"" said Barbox Brothers, quite as much embarrassed by his part",CD

377,"in the dialogue as the child could possibly be by his, ""is Phoebe?""",CD

378,"To which the child made answer: ""Why, Phoebe, of course.""",CD

379,"The small but sharp observer had eyed his questioner closely, and had",CD

380,"taken his moral measure. He lowered his guard, and rather assumed a tone",CD

381,with him: as having discovered him to be an unaccustomed person in the art of,CD

382,polite conversation.,CD

383,"""Phoebe,"" said the child, ""can't be anybobby else but Phoebe. Can she?""",CD

384,"""No, I suppose not.""",CD

385,"""Well,"" returned the child, ""then why did you ask me?""",CD

386,"Deeming it prudent to shift his ground, Barbox Brothers took up a new",CD

387,position.,CD

388,"""What do you do there? Up there in that room where the open window is.",CD

389,"What do you do there?""",CD

390,"""Cool,"" said the child.",CD

391,"""Eh?""",CD

392,"""Co-o-ol,"" the child repeated in a louder voice, lengthening out the word",CD

393,"with a fixed look and great emphasis, as much as to say: ""What's the use of",CD

394,"your having grown up, if you're such a donkey as not to understand me?""",CD

395,"""Ah! School, school,"" said Barbox Brothers. ""Yes, yes, yes. And Phoebe",CD

396,"teaches you?""",CD

397,The child nodded.,CD

398,"""Good boy.""",CD

399,"""Tound it out, have you?"" said the child.",CD

400,"""Yes, I have found it out. What would you do with twopence, if I gave it",CD

401,"you?""",CD

402,"""Pend it.""",CD

403,The knock-down promptitude of this reply leaving him not a leg to stand,CD

404,"upon, Barbox Brothers produced the twopence with great lameness, and",CD

405,withdrew in a state of humiliation.,CD

406,"But, seeing the face on the window-sill as he passed the cottage, he",CD

407,"acknowledged its presence there with a gesture, which was not a nod, not a",CD

408,"bow, not a removal of his hat from his head, but was a diffident compromise",CD

409,"between or struggle with all three. The eyes in the face seemed amused, or",CD

410,"cheered, or both, and the lips modestly said: ""Good day to you, sir.""",CD

411,"""I find I must stick for a time to Mugby Junction,"" said Barbox Brothers,",CD

412,"with much gravity, after once more stopping on his return road to look at the",CD

413,"Lines where they went their several ways so quietly. ""I can't make up my",CD

414,"mind yet, which iron road to take. In fact, I must get a little accustomed to the",CD

415,"Junction before I can decide.""",CD

416,"So, he announced at the Inn that he was ""going to stay on, for the present,""",CD

417,"and improved his acquaintance with the Junction that night, and again next",CD

418,"morning, and again next night and morning: going down to the station,",CD

419,"mingling with the people there, looking about him down all the avenues of",CD

420,"railway, and beginning to take an interest in the incomings and outgoings of",CD

421,"the trains. At first, he often put his head into Lamps's little room, but he never",CD

422,found Lamps there. A pair or two of velveteen shoulders he usually found,CD

423,"there, stooping over the fire, sometimes in connexion with a clasped knife and",CD

424,"a piece of bread and meat; but the answer to his inquiry, ""Where's Lamps?""",CD

425,"was, either that he was ""t'other side the line,"" or, that it was his off-time, or (in",CD

426,"the latter case), his own personal introduction to another Lamps who was not",CD

427,"his Lamps. However, he was not so desperately set upon seeing Lamps now,",CD

428,but he bore the disappointment. Nor did he so wholly devote himself to his,CD

429,"severe application to the study of Mugby Junction, as to neglect exercise. On",CD

430,"the contrary, he took a walk every day, and always the same walk. But the",CD

431,"weather turned cold and wet again, and the window was never open.",CD

432,III,CD

433,"At length, after a lapse of some days, there came another streak of fine",CD

434,"bright hardy autumn weather. It was a Saturday. The window was open, and",CD

435,"the children were gone. Not surprising, this, for he had patiently watched and",CD

436,"waited at the corner, until they were gone.",CD

437,"""Good day,"" he said to the face; absolutely getting his hat clear off his",CD

438,head this time.,CD

439,"""Good day to you, sir.""",CD

440,"""I am glad you have a fine sky again, to look at.""",CD

441,"""Thank you, sir. It is kind of you.""",CD

442,"""You are an invalid, I fear?""",CD

443,"""No, sir. I have very good health.""",CD

444,"""But are you not always lying down?""",CD

445,"""O yes, I am always lying down, because I cannot sit up. But I am not an",CD

446,"invalid.""",CD

447,The laughing eyes seemed highly to enjoy his great mistake.,CD

448,"""Would you mind taking the trouble to come in, sir? There is a beautiful",CD

449,view from this window. And you would see that I am not at all ill-being so,CD

450,"good as to care.""",CD

451,"It was said to help him, as he stood irresolute, but evidently desiring to",CD

452,"enter, with his diffident hand on the latch of the garden gate. It did help him,",CD

453,and he went in.,CD

454,The room up-stairs was a very clean white room with a low roof. Its only,CD

455,inmate lay on a couch that brought her face on a level with the window. The,CD

456,"couch was white too; and her simple dress or wrapper being light blue, like the",CD

457,"band around her hair, she had an ethereal look, and a fanciful appearance of",CD

458,lying among clouds. He felt that she instinctively perceived him to be by habit,CD

459,a downcast taciturn man; it was another help to him to have established that,CD

460,"understanding so easily, and got it over.",CD

461,"There was an awkward constraint upon him, nevertheless, as he touched",CD

462,"her hand, and took a chair at the side of her couch.",CD

463,"""I see now,"" he began, not at all fluently, ""how you occupy your hands.",CD

464,"Only seeing you from the path outside, I thought you were playing upon",CD

465,"something.""",CD

466,She was engaged in very nimbly and dexterously making lace. A lacepillow lay upon her breast; and the quick movements and changes of her hands,CD

467,"upon it as she worked, had given them the action he had misinterpreted.",CD

468,"""That is curious,"" she answered, with a bright smile. ""For I often fancy,",CD

469,"myself, that I play tunes while I am at work.""",CD

470,"""Have you any musical knowledge?""",CD

471,She shook her head.,CD

472,"""I think I could pick out tunes, if I had any instrument, which could be",CD

473,made as handy to me as my lace-pillow. But I dare say I deceive myself. At all,CD

474,"events, I shall never know.""",CD

475,"""You have a musical voice. Excuse me; I have heard you sing.""",CD

476,"""With the children?"" she answered, slightly colouring. ""O yes. I sing with",CD

477,"the dear children, if it can be called singing.""",CD

478,"Barbox Brothers glanced at the two small forms in the room, and hazarded",CD

479,"the speculation that she was fond of children, and that she was learned in new",CD

480,"systems of teaching them? ""Very fond of them,"" she said, shaking her head",CD

481,"again; ""but I know nothing of teaching, beyond the interest I have in it, and the",CD

482,pleasure it gives me when they learn. Perhaps your overhearing my little,CD

483,"scholars sing some of their lessons, has led you so far astray as to think me a",CD

484,"grand teacher? Ah! I thought so! No, I have only read and been told about that",CD

485,"system. It seemed so pretty and pleasant, and to treat them so like the merry",CD

486,"Robins they are, that I took up with it in my little way. You don't need to be",CD

487,"told what a very little way mine is, sir,"" she added, with a glance at the small",CD

488,forms and round the room.,CD

489,All this time her hands were busy at her lace-pillow. As they still,CD

490,"continued so, and as there was a kind of substitute for conversation in the click",CD

491,"and play of its pegs, Barbox Brothers took the opportunity of observing her.",CD

492,He guessed her to be thirty. The charm of her transparent face and large bright,CD

493,"brown eyes, was, not that they were passively resigned, but that they were",CD

494,"actively and thoroughly cheerful. Even her busy hands, which of their own",CD

495,"thinness alone might have besought compassion, plied their task with a gay",CD

496,courage that made mere compassion an unjustifiable assumption of,CD

497,"superiority, and an impertinence.",CD

498,"He saw her eyes in the act of rising towards his, and he directed his",CD

499,"towards the prospect, saying: ""Beautiful indeed!""",CD

500,"""Most beautiful, sir. I have sometimes had a fancy that I would like to sit",CD

501,"up, for once, only to try how it looks to an erect head. But what a foolish fancy",CD

502,that would be to encourage! It cannot look more lovely to any one than it does,CD

503,"to me.""",CD

504,"Her eyes were turned to it as she spoke, with most delighted admiration",CD

505,and enjoyment. There was not a trace in it of any sense of deprivation.,CD

506,"""And those threads of railway, with their puffs of smoke and steam",CD

507,"changing places so fast, make it so lively for me,"" she went on. ""I think of the",CD

508,"number of people who can go where they wish, on their business, or their",CD

509,pleasure; I remember that the puffs make signs to me that they are actually,CD

510,"going while I look; and that enlivens the prospect with abundance of company,",CD

511,"if I want company. There is the great Junction, too. I don't see it under the foot",CD

512,"of the hill, but I can very often hear it, and I always know it is there. It seems",CD

513,"to join me, in a way, to I don't know how many places and things that I shall",CD

514,"never see.""",CD

515,With an abashed kind of idea that it might have already joined himself to,CD

516,"something he had never seen, he said constrainedly: ""Just so.""",CD

517,"""And so you see, sir,"" pursued Phoebe, ""I am not the invalid you thought",CD

518,"me, and I am very well off indeed.""",CD

519,"""You have a happy disposition,"" said Barbox Brothers: perhaps with a",CD

520,slight excusatory touch for his own disposition.,CD

521,"""Ah! But you should know my father,"" she replied. ""His is the happy",CD

522,"disposition!-Don't mind, sir!"" For his reserve took the alarm at a step upon",CD

523,"the stairs, and he distrusted that he would be set down for a troublesome",CD

524,"intruder. ""This is my father coming.""",CD

525,"The door opened, and the father paused there.",CD

526,"""Why, Lamps!"" exclaimed Barbox Brothers, starting from his chair. ""How",CD

527,"do you do, Lamps?""",CD

528,"To which, Lamps responded: ""The gentleman for Nowhere! How do you",CD

529,"do, sir?""",CD

530,"And they shook hands, to the greatest admiration and surprise of Lamps's",CD

531,daughter.,CD

532,"""I have looked you up, half a dozen times since that night,"" said Barbox",CD

533,"Brothers, ""but have never found you.""",CD

534,"""So I've heerd on, sir, so I've heerd on,"" returned Lamps. ""It's your being",CD

535,"noticed so often down at the Junction, without taking any train, that has begun",CD

536,to get you the name among us of the gentleman for Nowhere. No offence in,CD

537,"my having called you by it when took by surprise, I hope, sir?""",CD

538,"""None at all. It's as good a name for me as any other you could call me by.",CD

539,"But may I ask you a question in the corner here?""",CD

540,"Lamps suffered himself to be led aside from his daughter's couch, by one",CD

541,of the buttons of his velveteen jacket.,CD

542,"""Is this the bedside where you sing your songs?""",CD

543,Lamps nodded.,CD

544,The gentleman for Nowhere clapped him on the shoulder; and they faced,CD

545,about again.,CD

546,"""Upon my word, my dear,"" said Lamps then to his daughter, looking from",CD

547,"her to her visitor, ""it is such an amaze to me, to find you brought acquainted",CD

548,"with this gentleman, that I must (if this gentleman will excuse me) take a",CD

549,"rounder.""",CD

550,"Mr. Lamps demonstrated in action what this meant, by pulling out his oily",CD

559,greatly restored by it.,CD

563,"""No, sir, nor never has done. You see, her mother (who died when she was",CD

569,"""Well, sir,"" pleaded Lamps, in behalf of the long-deceased. ""You see,",CD

570,"Phoebe and me, we have talked that over too. And Lord bless us! Such a",CD

571,"number on us has our infirmities, what with fits, and what with misfits, of one",CD

583,"that you may know my name-""",CD

584,"""Stay!"" interposed the visitor, with a slight flush. ""What signifies your",CD

585,name! Lamps is name enough for me. I like it. It is bright and expressive.,CD

586,"What do I want more!""",CD

587,"""Why to be sure, sir,"" returned Lamps. ""I have in general no other name",CD

588,"down at the Junction; but I thought, on account of your being here as a firstclass single, in a private character, that you might-""",CD

589,"The visitor waved the thought away with his hand, and Lamps",CD

590,acknowledged the mark of confidence by taking another rounder.,CD

591,"""You are hard-worked, I take for granted?"" said Barbox Brothers, when the",CD

592,subject of the rounder came out of it much dirtier than he went into it.,CD

593,"Lamps was beginning, ""Not particular so""-when his daughter took him",CD

594,up.,CD

611,"band.""",CD

612,"""I say! My dear! It's very fillyillially done, you know; but you are",CD

613,"flattering your father,"" he protested, sparkling.",CD

614,"""No I am not, sir, I assure you. No I am not. If you could hear my father",CD

615,"sing, you would know I am not. But you never will hear him sing, because he",CD

616,"never sings to any one but me. However tired he is, he always sings to me",CD

617,"when he comes home. When I lay here long ago, quite a poor little broken",CD

618,"doll, he used to sing to me. More than that, he used to make songs, bringing in",CD

619,"whatever little jokes we had between us. More than that, he often does so to",CD

620,"this day. O! I'll tell of you, father, as the gentleman has asked about you. He is",CD

621,"a poet, sir.""",CD

622,"""I shouldn't wish the gentleman, my dear,"" observed Lamps, for the",CD

623,"moment turning grave, ""to carry away that opinion of your father, because it",CD

624,might look as if I was given to asking the stars in a molloncolly manner what,CD

625,"they was up to. Which I wouldn't at once waste the time, and take the liberty,",CD

626,"my dear.""",CD

627,"""My father,"" resumed Phoebe, amending her text, ""is always on the bright",CD

628,"side, and the good side. You told me just now, I had a happy disposition. How",CD

629,"can I help it?""",CD

630,"""Well! but my dear,"" returned Lamps argumentatively, ""how can I help it?",CD

631,"Put it to yourself, sir. Look at her. Always as you see her now. Always",CD

632,"working-and after all, sir, for but a very few shillings a week-always",CD

633,"contented, always lively, always interested in others, of all sorts. I said, this",CD

634,"moment, she was always as you see her now. So she is, with a difference that",CD

635,"comes to much the same. For, when it's my Sunday off and the morning bells",CD

636,"have done ringing, I hear the prayers and thanks read in the touchingest way,",CD

637,"and I have the hymns sung to me-so soft, sir, that you couldn't hear 'em out",CD

638,"of this room-in notes that seem to me, I am sure, to come from Heaven and",CD

639,"go back to it.""",CD

640,It might have been merely through the association of these words with,CD

641,"their sacredly quiet time, or it might have been through the larger association",CD

642,of the words with the Redeemer's presence beside the bedridden; but here her,CD

643,"dexterous fingers came to a stop on the lace-pillow, and clasped themselves",CD

644,round his neck as he bent down. There was great natural sensibility in both,CD

645,"father and daughter, the visitor could easily see; but each made it, for the",CD

646,"other's sake, retiring, not demonstrative; and perfect cheerfulness, intuitive or",CD

647,"acquired, was either the first or second nature of both. In a very few moments,",CD

648,"Lamps was taking another rounder with his comical features beaming, while",CD

649,Phoebe's laughing eyes (just a glistening speck or so upon their lashes) were,CD

650,"again directed by turns to him, and to her work, and to Barbox Brothers.",CD

651,"""When my father, sir,"" she said brightly, ""tells you about my being",CD

652,"interested in other people even though they know nothing about me-which,",CD

653,"by-the-by, I told you myself-you ought to know how that comes about.",CD

654,"That's my father's doing.""",CD

655,"""No, it isn't!"" he protested.",CD

656,"""Don't you believe him, sir; yes, it is. He tells me of everything he sees",CD

657,down at his work. You would be surprised what a quantity he gets together for,CD

658,"me every day. He looks into the carriages, and tells me how the ladies are drest",CD

659,"-so that I know all the fashions! He looks into the carriages, and tells me",CD

660,"what pairs of lovers he sees, and what new-married couples on their wedding",CD

661,trip-so that I know all about that! He collects chance newspapers and books,CD

662,-so that I have plenty to read! He tells me about the sick people who are,CD

663,"travelling to try to get better-so that I know all about them! In short, as I",CD

664,"began by saying, he tells me everything he sees and makes out, down at his",CD

665,"work, and you can't think what a quantity he does see and make out.""",CD

666,"""As to collecting newspapers and books, my dear,"" said Lamps, ""it's clear",CD

667,"I can have no merit in that, because they're not my perquisites. You see, sir,",CD

668,"it's this way: A Guard, he'll say to me, 'Hallo, here you are, Lamps. I've saved",CD

669,"this paper for your daughter. How is she agoing on?' A Head-Porter, he'll say",CD

670,"to me, 'Here! Catch hold, Lamps. Here's a couple of wollumes for your",CD

671,daughter. Is she pretty much where she were?' And that's what makes it,CD

672,"double welcome, you see. If she had a thousand pound in' a box, they",CD

673,"wouldn't trouble themselves about her; but being what she is-that is, you",CD

674,"understand,"" Lamps added, somewhat hurriedly, ""not having a thousand pound",CD

675,"in a box-they take thought for her. And as concerning the young pairs,",CD

676,"married and unmarried, it's only natural I should bring home what little I can",CD

677,"about them, seeing that there's not a Couple of either sort in the",CD

678,"neighbourhood that don't come of their own accord to confide in Phoebe.""",CD

679,"She raised her eyes triumphantly to Barbox Brothers, as she said:",CD

680,"""Indeed, sir, that is true. If I could have got up and gone to church, I don't",CD

681,know how often I should have been a bridesmaid. But if I could have done,CD

682,"that, some girls in love might have been jealous of me, and as it is, no girl is",CD

683,jealous of me. And my pillow would not have been half as ready to put the,CD

684,"piece of cake under, as I always find it,"" she added, turning her face on it with",CD

685,"a light sigh, and a smile at her father.",CD

686,"The arrival of a little girl, the biggest of the scholars, now led to an",CD

687,"understanding on the part of Barbox Brothers, that she was the domestic of the",CD

688,"cottage, and had come to take active measures in it, attended by a pail that",CD

689,"might have extinguished her, and a broom three times her height. He therefore",CD

690,"rose to take his leave, and took it; saying that if Phoebe had no objection, he",CD

691,would come again.,CD

692,"He had muttered that he would come ""in the course of his walks."" The",CD

693,"course of his walks must have been highly favourable to his return, for he",CD

694,returned after an interval of a single day.,CD

695,"""You thought you would never see me any more, I suppose?"" he said to",CD

696,"Phoebe as he touched her hand, and sat down by her couch.",CD

698,"""I took it for granted you would mistrust me.""",CD

699,"""For granted, sir? Have you been so much mistrusted?""",CD

700,"""I think I am justified in answering yes. But I may have mistrusted too, on",CD

701,my part. No matter just now. We were speaking of the Junction last time. I,CD

702,"have passed hours there since the day before yesterday.""",CD

703,"""Are you now the gentleman for Somewhere?"" she asked with a smile.",CD

704,"""Certainly for Somewhere; but I don't yet know Where. You would never",CD

707,"Her hands stopped in her work, and she looked at him with incredulous",CD

708,astonishment.,CD

709,"""Yes,"" said Barbox Brothers, not quite easy in his chair, ""from my",CD

710,"birthday. I am, to myself, an unintelligible book with the earlier chapters all",CD

711,"torn out, and thrown away. My childhood had no grace of childhood, my youth",CD

712,"had no charm of youth, and what can be expected from such a lost",CD

713,"beginning?"" His eyes meeting hers as they were addressed intently to him,",CD

714,"something seemed to stir within his breast, whispering: ""Was this bed a place",CD

715,"for the graces of childhood and the charms of youth to take to, kindly? O",CD

716,"shame, shame!""",CD

717,"""It is a disease with me,"" said Barbox Brothers, checking himself, and",CD

718,"making as though he had a difficulty in swallowing something, ""to go wrong",CD

719,about that. I don't know how I came to speak of that. I hope it is because of an,CD

720,old misplaced confidence in one of your sex involving an old bitter treachery. I,CD

721,"don't know. I am all wrong together.""",CD

722,"Her hands quietly and slowly resumed their work. Glancing at her, he saw",CD

723,that her eyes were thoughtfully following them.,CD

724,"""I am travelling from my birthday,"" he resumed, ""because it has always",CD

725,been a dreary day to me. My first free birthday coming round some five or six,CD

726,"weeks hence, I am travelling to put its predecessors far behind me, and to try",CD

727,"to crush the day-or, at all events, put it out of my sight-by heaping new",CD

728,"objects on it.""",CD

729,"As he paused, she looked at him; but only shook her head as being quite at",CD

730,a loss.,CD

731,"""This is unintelligible to your happy disposition,"" he pursued, abiding by",CD

732,"his former phrase as if there were some lingering virtue of self-defence in it: ""I",CD

733,"knew it would be, and am glad it is. However, on this travel of mine (in which",CD

734,"I mean to pass the rest of my days, having abandoned all thought of a fixed",CD

735,"home), I stopped, as you heard from your father, at the Junction here. The",CD

736,"extent of its ramifications quite confused me as to whither I should go, from",CD

737,"here. I have not yet settled, being still perplexed among so many roads. What",CD

738,do you think I mean to do? How many of the branching roads can you see,CD

739,"from your window?""",CD

740,"Looking out, full of interest, she answered, ""Seven.""",CD

741,"""Seven,"" said Barbox Brothers, watching her with a grave smile. ""Well! I",CD

742,"propose to myself, at once to reduce the gross number to those very seven, and",CD

743,gradually to fine them down to one-the most promising for me-and to take,CD

744,"that.""",CD

745,"""But how will you know, sir, which is the most promising?"" she asked,",CD

746,with her brightened eyes roving over the view.,CD

747,"""Ah!"" said Barbox Brothers, with another grave smile, and considerably",CD

748,"improving in his ease of speech. ""To be sure. In this way. Where your father",CD

749,"can pick up so much every day for a good purpose, I may once and again pick",CD

750,up a little for an indifferent purpose. The gentleman for Nowhere must become,CD

751,"still better known at the Junction. He shall continue to explore it, until he",CD

752,"attaches something that he has seen, heard, or found out, at the head of each of",CD

753,"the seven roads, to the road itself. And so his choice of a road shall be",CD

754,"determined by his choice among his discoveries.""",CD

755,"Her hands still busy, she again glanced at the prospect, as if it",CD

756,"comprehended something that had not been in it before, and laughed as if it",CD

757,yielded her new pleasure.,CD

758,"""But I must not forget,"" said Barbox Brothers, ""(having got so far) to ask a",CD

759,favour. I want your help in this expedient of mine. I want to bring you what I,CD

760,"pick up at the heads of the seven roads that you lie here looking out at, and to",CD

761,compare notes with you about it. May I? They say two heads are better than,CD

762,one. I should say myself that probably depends upon the heads concerned. But,CD

763,"I am quite sure, though we are so newly acquainted, that your head and your",CD

764,"father's have found out better things, Phoebe, than ever mine of itself",CD

765,"discovered.""",CD

766,"She gave him her sympathetic right hand, in perfect rapture with his",CD

767,"proposal, and eagerly and gratefully thanked him.",CD

768,"""That's well!"" said Barbox Brothers. ""Again I must not forget (having got",CD

769,"so far) to ask a favour. Will you shut your eyes?""",CD

770,"Laughing playfully at the strange nature of the request, she did so.",CD

771,"""Keep them shut,"" said Barbox Brothers, going softly to the door, and",CD

772,"coming back. ""You are on your honour, mind, not to open your eyes until I tell",CD

773,"you that you may?""",CD

774,"""Yes! On my honour.""",CD

775,"""Good. May I take your lace-pillow from you for a minute?""",CD

776,"Still laughing and wondering, she removed her hands from it, and he put it",CD

777,aside.,CD

778,"""Tell me. Did you see the puffs of smoke and steam made by the morning",CD

779,"fast-train yesterday on road number seven from here?""",CD

780,"""Behind the elm-trees and the spire?""",CD

781,"""That's the road,"" said Barbox Brothers, directing his eyes towards it.",CD

782,"""Yes. I watched them melt away.""",CD

783,"""Anything unusual in what they expressed?""",CD

784,"""No!"" she answered merrily.",CD

785,"""Not complimentary to me, for I was in that train. I went-don't open your",CD

786,"eyes-to fetch you this, from the great ingenious town. It is not half so large",CD

787,"as your lace-pillow, and lies easily and lightly in its place. These little keys are",CD

788,"like the keys of a miniature piano, and you supply the air required with your",CD

789,"left hand. May you pick out delightful music from it, my dear! For the present",CD

790,"-you can open your eyes now-good-bye!""",CD

791,"In his embarrassed way, he closed the door upon himself, and only saw, in",CD

792,"doing so, that she ecstatically took the present to her bosom and caressed it.",CD

793,"The glimpse gladdened his heart, and yet saddened it; for so might she, if her",CD

794,"youth had flourished in its natural course, have taken to her breast that day the",CD

795,slumbering music of her own child's voice.,CD

796,BARBOX BROTHERS AND CO.,CD

797,"With good will and earnest purpose, the gentleman for Nowhere began, on",CD

798,"the very next day, his researches at the heads of the seven roads. The results of",CD

799,"his researches, as he and Phoebe afterwards set them down in fair writing, hold",CD

800,"their due places in this veracious chronicle, from its seventeenth page, onward.",CD

801,But they occupied a much longer time in the getting together than they ever,CD

802,"will in the perusal. And this is probably the case with most reading matter,",CD

803,except when it is of that highly beneficial kind (for Posterity) which is,CD

804,"""thrown off in a few moments of leisure"" by the superior poetic geniuses who",CD

805,scorn to take prose pains.,CD

806,"It must be admitted, however, that Barbox by no means hurried himself.",CD

807,"His heart being in his work of good-nature, he revelled in it. There was the joy,",CD

808,"too (it was a true joy to him), of sometimes sitting by, listening to Phoebe as",CD

809,"she picked out more and more discourse from her musical instrument, and as",CD

810,her natural taste and ear refined daily upon her first discoveries. Besides being,CD

811,"a pleasure, this was an occupation, and in the course of weeks it consumed",CD

812,hours. It resulted that his dreaded birthday was close upon him before he had,CD

813,troubled himself any more about it.,CD

814,The matter was made more pressing by the unforeseen circumstance that,CD

815,"the councils held (at which Mr. Lamps, beaming most brilliantly, on a few rare",CD

816,"occasions assisted) respecting the road to be selected, were, after all, in no",CD

817,"wise assisted by his investigations. For, he had connected this interest with this",CD

818,"road, or that interest with the other, but could deduce no reason from it for",CD

819,"giving any road the preference. Consequently, when the last council was",CD

820,"holden, that part of the business stood, in the end, exactly where it had stood in",CD

821,the beginning.,CD

822,"""But, sir,"" remarked Phoebe, ""we have only six roads after all. Is the",CD

823,"seventh road dumb?""",CD

824,"""The seventh road? O!"" said Barbox Brothers, rubbing his chin. ""That is",CD

825,"the road I took, you know, when I went to get your little present. That is its",CD

826,"story, Phoebe.""",CD

827,"""Would you mind taking that road again, sir?"" she asked with hesitation.",CD

828,"""Not in the least; it is a great high road after all.""",CD

829,"""I should like you to take it,"" returned Phoebe, with a persuasive smile,",CD

830,"""for the love of that little present which must ever be so dear to me. I should",CD

831,"like you to take it, because that road can never be again, like any other road to",CD

832,"me. I should like you to take it, in remembrance of your having done me so",CD

833,much good: of your having made me so much happier! If you leave me by the,CD

834,"road you travelled when you went to do me this great kindness,"" sounding a",CD

835,"faint chord as she spoke, ""I shall feel, lying here watching at my window, as if",CD

836,"it must conduct you to a prosperous end, and bring you back some day.""",CD

837,"""It shall be done, my dear; it shall be done.""",CD

838,"So at last the gentleman for Nowhere took a ticket for Somewhere, and his",CD

839,destination was the great ingenious town.,CD

840,He had loitered so long about the Junction that it was the eighteenth of,CD

841,"December when he left it. ""High time,"" he reflected, as he seated himself in",CD

842,"the train, ""that I started in earnest! Only one clear day remains between me",CD

843,"and the day I am running away from. I'll push onward for the hill-country tomorrow. I'll go to Wales.""",CD

844,It was with some pains that he placed before himself the undeniable,CD

845,advantages to be gained in the way of novel occupation for his senses from,CD

846,"misty mountains, swollen streams, rain, cold, a wild seashore, and rugged",CD

847,roads. And yet he scarcely made them out as distinctly as he could have,CD

848,"wished. Whether the poor girl, in spite of her new resource, her music, would",CD

849,have any feeling of loneliness upon her now-just at first-that she had not,CD

850,"had before; whether she saw those very puffs of steam and smoke that he saw,",CD

851,as he sat in the train thinking of her; whether her face would have any pensive,CD

852,"shadow on it as they died out of the distant view from her window; whether, in",CD

853,"telling him he had done her so much good, she had not unconsciously",CD

854,"corrected his old moody bemoaning of his station in life, by setting him",CD

855,"thinking that a man might be a great healer, if he would, and yet not be a great",CD

856,doctor; these and other similar meditations got between him and his Welsh,CD

857,"picture. There was within him, too, that dull sense of vacuity which follows",CD

858,"separation from an object of interest, and cessation of a pleasant pursuit; and",CD

859,"this sense, being quite new to him, made him restless. Further, in losing",CD

860,Mugby Junction he had found himself again; and he was not the more,CD

861,enamoured of himself for having lately passed his time in better company.,CD

862,"But surely, here not far ahead, must be the great ingenious town. This",CD

863,"crashing and clashing that the train was undergoing, and this coupling on to it",CD

864,"of a multitude of new echoes, could mean nothing less than approach to the",CD

865,great station. It did mean nothing less. After some stormy flashes of town,CD

866,"lightning, in the way of swift revelations of red-brick blocks of houses, high",CD

867,"red-brick chimney-shafts, vistas of red-brick railway arches, tongues of fire,",CD

868,"blots of smoke, valleys of canal, and hills of coal, there came the thundering in",CD

869,at the journey's end.,CD

870,"Having seen his portmanteaus safely housed in the hotel he chose, and",CD

871,"having appointed his dinner-hour, Barbox Brothers went out for a walk in the",CD

872,busy streets. And now it began to be suspected by him that Mugby Junction,CD

873,"was a Junction of many branches, invisible as well as visible, and had joined",CD

874,"him to an endless number of byways. For, whereas he would, but a little while",CD

875,"ago, have walked these streets blindly brooding, he now had eyes and thoughts",CD

876,"for a new external world. How the many toiling people lived, and loved, and",CD

877,"died; how wonderful it was to consider the various trainings of eye and hand,",CD

878,"the nice distinctions of sight and touch, that separated them into classes of",CD

879,"workers, and even into classes of workers at subdivisions of one complete",CD

880,"whole which combined their many intelligences and forces, though of itself",CD

881,but some cheap object of use or ornament in common life; how good it was to,CD

882,"know that such assembling in a multitude on their part, and such contribution",CD

883,"of their several dexterities towards a civilising end, did not deteriorate them as",CD

884,"it was the fashion of the supercilious May-flies of humanity to pretend, but",CD

885,engendered among them a self-respect and yet a modest desire to be much,CD

886,wiser than they were (the first evinced in their well-balanced bearing and,CD

887,"manner of speech when he stopped to ask a question; the second, in the",CD

888,announcements of their popular studies and amusements on the public walls);,CD

889,"these considerations, and a host of such, made his walk a memorable one. ""I",CD

890,"too am but a little part of a great whole,"" he began to think; ""and to be",CD

891,"serviceable to myself and others, or to be happy, I must cast my interest into,",CD

892,"and draw it out of, the common stock.""",CD

893,"Although he had arrived at his journey's end for the day by noon, he had",CD

894,since insensibly walked about the town so far and so long that the lamplighters,CD

895,"were now at their work in the streets, and the shops were sparkling up",CD

896,"brilliantly. Thus reminded to turn towards his quarters, he was in the act of",CD

897,"doing so, when a very little hand crept into his, and a very little voice said:",CD

898,"""O! If you please, I am lost.""",CD

899,"He looked down, and saw a very little fair-haired girl.",CD

900,"""Yes,"" she said, confirming her words with a serious nod. ""I am indeed. I",CD

901,"am lost.""",CD

902,"Greatly perplexed, he stopped, looked about him for help, descried none,",CD

903,"and said, bending low: ""Where do you live, my child?""",CD

904,"""I don't know where I live,"" she returned. ""I am lost.""",CD

935,"his little companion, with a clumsy feeling on him as if he had just developed",CD

936,"into a foolish giant. She, clearly elevated in her own tiny opinion by having",CD

997,"Perfectly at ease and peace, Polly came along, but, finding the stairs rather",CD

1007,"shaky beginning, but under encouragement did very fairly. There was a want",CD

1008,"of breadth observable in his rendering of the cheeks, as well as the appetite, of",CD

1009,"the boy; and there was a certain tameness in his fairy, referable to an undercurrent of desire to account for her. Still, as the first lumbering performance of",CD

1029,"and a screen, and close in Polly and himself before the fire, as it were in a",CD

1207,"""Ponies, I am,"" said Polly, ""especially when their tails are long. But horses",CD

1208,"-n-no-too big, you know.""",CD

1209,"""Well,"" pursued Barbox Brothers, in a spirit of grave mysterious",CD

1210,"confidence adapted to the importance of the consultation, ""I did see yesterday,",CD

1211,"Polly, on the walls, pictures of two long-tailed ponies, speckled all over-""",CD

1212,"""No, no, no!"" cried Polly, in an ecstatic desire to linger on the charming",CD

1213,"details. ""Not speckled all over!""",CD

1214,"""Speckled all over. Which ponies jump through hoops-""",CD

1215,"""No, no, no!"" cried Polly, as before. ""They never jump through hoops!""",CD

1216,"""Yes, they do. O I assure you, they do. And eat pie in pinafores-""",CD

1217,"""Ponies eating pie in pinafores!"" said Polly. ""What a story-teller you are,",CD

1218,"ain't you?""",CD

1219,"""Upon my honour.-And fire off guns.""",CD

1220,(Polly hardly seemed to see the force of the ponies resorting to fire-arms.),CD

1221,"""And I was thinking,"" pursued the exemplary Barbox, ""that if you and I",CD

1222,"were to go to the Circus where these ponies are, it would do our constitutions",CD

1223,"good.""",CD

1224,"""Does that mean, amuse us?"" inquired Polly. ""What long words you do",CD

1225,"use, don't you?""",CD

1226,"Apologetic for having wandered out of his depth, he replied: ""That means,",CD

1227,amuse us. That is exactly what it means. There are many other wonders,CD

1228,"besides the ponies, and we shall see them all. Ladies and gentlemen in",CD

1229,"spangled dresses, and elephants and lions and tigers.""",CD

1230,"Polly became observant of the teapot, with a curled-up nose indicating",CD

1231,"some uneasiness of mind. ""They never get out, of course,"" she remarked as a",CD

1232,mere truism.,CD

1233,"""The elephants and lions and tigers? O dear no!""",CD

1234,"""O dear no!"" said Polly. ""And of course nobody's afraid of the ponies",CD

1235,"shooting anybody.""",CD

1236,"""Not the least in the world.""",CD

1237,"""No, no, not the least in the world,"" said Polly.",CD

1238,"""I was also thinking,"" proceeded Barbox, ""that if we were to look in at the",CD

1239,"toy-shop, to choose a doll-""",CD

1240,"""Not dressed!"" cried Polly, with a clap of her hands. ""No, no, no, not",CD

1241,"dressed!""",CD

1242,"""Full dressed. Together with a house, and all things necessary for",CD

1243,"housekeeping-""",CD

1244,"Polly gave a little scream, and seemed in danger of falling into a swoon of",CD

1245,"bliss. ""What a darling you are!"" she languidly exclaimed, leaning back in her",CD

1246,"chair. ""Come and be hugged, or I must come and hug you!""",CD

1247,This resplendent programme was carried into execution with the utmost,CD

1248,rigour of the law. It being essential to make the purchase of the doll its first,CD

1249,feature-or that lady would have lost the ponies-the toy-shop expedition,CD

1250,"took precedence. Polly in the magic warehouse, with a doll as large as herself",CD

1251,"under each arm, and a neat assortment of some twenty more on view upon the",CD

1252,"counter, did indeed present a spectacle of indecision not quite compatible with",CD

1253,"unalloyed happiness, but the light cloud passed. The lovely specimen oftenest",CD

1254,"chosen, oftenest rejected, and finally abided by, was of Circassian descent,",CD

1255,possessing as much boldness of beauty as was reconcilable with extreme,CD

1256,"feebleness of mouth, and combining a sky-blue silk pelisse with rose-coloured",CD

1257,"satin trousers, and a black velvet hat: which this fair stranger to our northern",CD

1258,shores would seem to have founded on the portraits of the late Duchess of,CD

1259,Kent. The name this distinguished foreigner brought with her from beneath the,CD

1260,"glowing skies of a sunny clime was (on Polly's authority) Miss Melluka, and",CD

1261,"the costly nature of her outfit as a housekeeper, from the Barbox coffers, may",CD

1262,be inferred from the two facts that her silver teaspoons were as large as her,CD

1263,"kitchen poker, and that the proportions of her watch exceeded those of her",CD

1264,frying-pan. Miss Melluka was graciously pleased to express her entire,CD

1265,"approbation of the Circus, and so was Polly; for the ponies were speckled, and",CD

1266,"brought down nobody when they fired, and the savagery of the wild beasts",CD

1267,"appeared to be mere smoke-which article, in fact, they did produce in large",CD

1268,quantities from their insides. The Barbox absorption in the general subject,CD

1269,"throughout the realisation of these delights was again a sight to see, nor was it",CD

1270,"less worthy to behold at dinner, when he drank to Miss Melluka, tied stiff in a",CD

1271,"chair opposite to Polly (the fair Circassian possessing an unbendable spine),",CD

1272,and even induced the waiter to assist in carrying out with due decorum the,CD

1273,"prevailing glorious idea. To wind up, there came the agreeable fever of getting",CD

1274,"Miss Melluka and all her wardrobe and rich possessions into a fly with Polly,",CD

1275,to be taken home. But by that time Polly had become unable to look upon such,CD

1276,"accumulated joys with waking eyes, and had withdrawn her consciousness",CD

1277,"into the wonderful Paradise of a child's sleep. ""Sleep, Polly, sleep,"" said",CD

1278,"Barbox Brothers, as her head dropped on his shoulder; ""you shall not fall out",CD

1279,"of this bed, easily, at any rate!""",CD

1280,"What rustling piece of paper he took from his pocket, and carefully folded",CD

1281,"into the bosom of Polly's frock, shall not be mentioned. He said nothing about",CD

1282,"it, and nothing shall be said about it. They drove to a modest suburb of the",CD

1283,"great ingenious town, and stopped at the forecourt of a small house. ""Do not",CD

1284,"wake the child,"" said Barbox Brothers, softly, to the driver, ""I will carry her in",CD

1285,"as she is.""",CD

1286,"Greeting the light at the opened door which was held by Polly's mother,",CD

1287,Polly's bearer passed on with mother and child into a ground-floor room.,CD

1289,with his emaciated hands.,CD

1290,"""Tresham,"" said Barbox, in a kindly voice, ""I have brought you back your",CD

1291,"Polly, fast asleep. Give me your hand, and tell me you are better.""",CD

1292,"The sick man reached forth his right hand, and bowed his head over the",CD

1302,"As the father held out his arms for the child, each of the two men looked",CD

1305,"""Unutterably dear.""",CD

1306,"""God bless her! It is not much, Polly,"" he continued, turning his eyes upon",CD

1308,and sinful man to invoke a blessing on something so far better than himself as,CD

1309,"a little child is; but it would be much-much upon his cruel head, and much",CD

1310,upon his guilty soul-if he could be so wicked as to invoke a curse. He had,CD

1311,"better have a millstone round his neck, and be cast into the deepest sea. Live",CD

1312,"and thrive, my pretty baby!"" Here he kissed her. ""Live and prosper, and",CD

1313,"become in time the mother of other little children, like the Angels who behold",CD

1314,"The Father's face!""",CD

1315,"He kissed her again, gave her up gently to both her parents, and went out.",CD

1316,"But he went not to Wales. No, he never went to Wales. He went",CD

1317,"straightway for another stroll about the town, and he looked in upon the people",CD

1318,"at their work, and at their play, here, there, everywhere, and where not. For he",CD

1319,"was Barbox Brothers and Co. now, and had taken thousands of partners into",CD

1320,the solitary firm.,CD

1321,"He had at length got back to his hotel room, and was standing before his",CD

1322,fire refreshing himself with a glass of hot drink which he had stood upon the,CD

1324,"watch, found the evening to have so slipped away, that they were striking",CD

1648,No. 1 BRANCH LINE,CD

1649,THE SIGNAL-MAN,CD

1650,"""Halloa! Below there!""",CD

1651,"When he heard a voice thus calling to him, he was standing at the door of",CD

1652,"his box, with a flag in his hand, furled round its short pole. One would have",CD

1653,"thought, considering the nature of the ground, that he could not have doubted",CD

1654,"from what quarter the voice came; but, instead of looking up to where I stood",CD

1655,"on the top of the steep cutting nearly over his head, he turned himself about",CD

1656,and looked down the Line. There was something remarkable in his manner of,CD

1657,"doing so, though I could not have said, for my life, what. But, I know it was",CD

1658,"remarkable enough to attract my notice, even though his figure was",CD

1659,"foreshortened and shadowed, down in the deep trench, and mine was high",CD

1660,"above him, so steeped in the glow of an angry sunset that I had shaded my",CD

1661,eyes with my hand before I saw him at all.,CD

1662,"""Halloa! Below!""",CD

1663,"From looking down the Line, he turned himself about again, and, raising",CD

1664,"his eyes, saw my figure high above him.",CD

1665,"""Is there any path by which I can come down and speak to you?""",CD

1666,"He looked up at me without replying, and I looked down at him without",CD

1667,"pressing him too soon with a repetition of my idle question. Just then, there",CD

1668,"came a vague vibration in the earth and air, quickly changing into a violent",CD

1669,"pulsation, and an oncoming rush that caused me to start back, as though it had",CD

1670,force to draw me down. When such vapour as rose to my height from this,CD

1671,"rapid train, had passed me and was skimming away over the landscape, I",CD

1672,looked down again and saw him re-furling the flag he had shown while the,CD

1673,train went by.,CD

1674,"I repeated my inquiry. After a pause, during which he seemed to regard me",CD

1675,"with fixed attention, he motioned with his rolled-up flag towards a point on",CD

1676,"my level, some two or three hundred yards distant. I called down to him, ""All",CD

1677,"right!"" and made for that point. There, by dint of looking closely about me, I",CD

1678,found a rough zig-zag descending path notched out: which I followed.,CD

1679,"The cutting was extremely deep, and unusually precipitate. It was made",CD

1680,through a clammy stone that became oozier and wetter as I went down. For,CD

1681,"these reasons, I found the way long enough to give me time to recall a singular",CD

1682,air of reluctance or compulsion with which he had pointed out the path.,CD

1683,"When I came down low enough upon the zig-zag descent, to see him",CD

1684,"again, I saw that he was standing between the rails on the way by which the",CD

1685,"train had lately passed, in an attitude as if he were waiting for me to appear.",CD

1686,"He had his left hand at his chin, and that left elbow rested on his right hand",CD

1687,crossed over his breast. His attitude was one of such expectation and,CD

1688,"watchfulness, that I stopped a moment, wondering at it.",CD

1689,"I resumed my downward way, and, stepping out upon the level of the",CD

1690,"railroad and drawing nearer to him, saw that he was a dark sallow man, with a",CD

1691,dark beard and rather heavy eyebrows. His post was in as solitary and dismal a,CD

1692,"place as ever I saw. On either side, a dripping-wet wall of jagged stone,",CD

1693,"excluding all view but a strip of sky; the perspective one way, only a crooked",CD

1694,prolongation of this great dungeon; the shorter perspective in the other,CD

1695,"direction, terminating in a gloomy red light, and the gloomier entrance to a",CD

1696,"black tunnel, in whose massive architecture there was a barbarous, depressing,",CD

1697,"and forbidding air. So little sunlight ever found its way to this spot, that it had",CD

1698,"an earthy deadly smell; and so much cold wind rushed through it, that it struck",CD

1699,"chill to me, as if I had left the natural world.",CD

1700,"Before he stirred, I was near enough to him to have touched him. Not even",CD

1701,"then removing his eyes from mine, he stepped back one step, and lifted his",CD

1702,hand.,CD

1703,"This was a lonesome post to occupy (I said), and it had riveted my",CD

1704,"attention when I looked down from up yonder. A visitor was a rarity, I should",CD

1705,"suppose; not an unwelcome rarity, I hoped? In me, he merely saw a man who",CD

1706,"had been shut up within narrow limits all his life, and who, being at last set",CD

1707,"free, had a newly-awakened interest in these great works. To such purpose I",CD

1708,"spoke to him; but I am far from sure of the terms I used, for, besides that I am",CD

1709,"not happy in opening any conversation, there was something in the man that",CD

1710,daunted me.,CD

1711,He directed a most curious look towards the red light near the tunnel's,CD

1712,"mouth, and looked all about it, as if something were missing from it, and then",CD

1713,looked at me.,CD

1714,That light was part of his charge? Was it not?,CD

1715,"He answered in a low voice: ""Don't you know it is?""",CD

1716,The monstrous thought came into my mind as I perused the fixed eyes and,CD

1717,"the saturnine face, that this was a spirit, not a man. I have speculated since,",CD

1718,whether there may have been infection in his mind.,CD

1719,"In my turn, I stepped back. But in making the action, I detected in his eyes",CD

1720,some latent fear of me. This put the monstrous thought to flight.,CD

1721,"""You look at me,"" I said, forcing a smile, ""as if you had a dread of me.""",CD

1722,"""I was doubtful,"" he returned, ""whether I had seen you before.""",CD

1723,"""Where?""",CD

1724,He pointed to the red light he had looked at.,CD

1725,"""There?"" I said.",CD

1726,"Intently watchful of me, he replied (but without sound), ""Yes.""",CD

1727,"""My good fellow, what should I do there? However, be that as it may, I",CD

1728,"never was there, you may swear.""",CD

1729,"""I think I may,"" he rejoined. ""Yes. I am sure I may.""",CD

1730,"His manner cleared, like my own. He replied to my remarks with",CD

1731,"readiness, and in well-chosen words. Had he much to do there? Yes; that was",CD

1732,"to say, he had enough responsibility to bear; but exactness and watchfulness",CD

1733,"were what was required of him, and of actual work-manual labour-he had",CD

1734,"next to none. To change that signal, to trim those lights, and to turn this iron",CD

1735,"handle now and then, was all he had to do under that head. Regarding those",CD

1736,"many long and lonely hours of which I seemed to make so much, he could",CD

1737,"only say that the routine of his life had shaped itself into that form, and he had",CD

1738,grown used to it. He had taught himself a language down here-if only to,CD

1739,"know it by sight, and to have formed his own crude ideas of its pronunciation,",CD

1740,"could be called learning it. He had also worked at fractions and decimals, and",CD

1741,"tried a little algebra; but he was, and had been as a boy, a poor hand at figures.",CD

1742,"Was it necessary for him when on duty, always to remain in that channel of",CD

1743,"damp air, and could he never rise into the sunshine from between those high",CD

1744,"stone walls? Why, that depended upon times and circumstances. Under some",CD

1745,"conditions there would be less upon the Line than under others, and the same",CD

1746,"held good as to certain hours of the day and night. In bright weather, he did",CD

1747,"choose occasions for getting a little above these lower shadows; but, being at",CD

1748,"all times liable to be called by his electric bell, and at such times listening for",CD

1749,"it with redoubled anxiety, the relief was less than I would suppose.",CD

1750,"He took me into his box, where there was a fire, a desk for an official book",CD

1751,"in which he had to make certain entries, a telegraphic instrument with its dial",CD

1752,"face and needles, and the little bell of which he had spoken. On my trusting",CD

1753,"that he would excuse the remark that he had been well educated, and (I hoped",CD

1754,"I might say without offence), perhaps educated above that station, he observed",CD

1755,that instances of slight incongruity in such-wise would rarely be found,CD

1756,wanting among large bodies of men; that he had heard it was so in,CD

1757,"workhouses, in the police force, even in that last desperate resource, the army;",CD

1758,"and that he knew it was so, more or less, in any great railway staff. He had",CD

1759,"been, when young (if I could believe it, sitting in that hut; he scarcely could), a",CD

1760,"student of natural philosophy, and had attended lectures; but he had run wild,",CD

1761,"misused his opportunities, gone down, and never risen again. He had no",CD

1762,"complaint to offer about that. He had made his bed, and he lay upon it. It was",CD

1763,far too late to make another.,CD

1764,"All that I have here condensed, he said in a quiet manner, with his grave",CD

1765,"dark regards divided between me and the fire. He threw in the word ""Sir,""",CD

1766,"from time to time, and especially when he referred to his youth: as though to",CD

1767,request me to understand that he claimed to be nothing but what I found him.,CD

1768,"He was several times interrupted by the little bell, and had to read off",CD

1769,"messages, and send replies. Once, he had to stand without the door, and",CD

1770,"display a flag as a train passed, and make some verbal communication to the",CD

1771,driver. In the discharge of his duties I observed him to be remarkably exact,CD

1772,"and vigilant, breaking off his discourse at a syllable, and remaining silent until",CD

2068,"boys. It ain't many in all those years.""",CD

2069,These startling words he uttered in a serious tone as he leaned against the,CD

2070,"Station-wall. He was a thick-set, ruddy-faced man, with coal-black eyes, the",CD

2071,"whites of which were not white, but a brownish-yellow, and apparently scarred",CD

2072,"and seamed, as if they had been operated upon. They were eyes that had",CD

2073,worked hard in looking through wind and weather. He was dressed in a short,CD

2074,"black pea-jacket and grimy white canvas trousers, and wore on his head a flat",CD

2075,black cap. There was no sign of levity in his face. His look was serious even to,CD

2076,"sadness, and there was an air of responsibility about his whole bearing which",CD

2077,assured me that he spoke in earnest.,CD

2078,"""Yes, sir, I have been for five-and-twenty years a Locomotive Enginedriver; and in all that time, I've only killed seven men and boys. There's not",CD

2079,"many of my mates as can say as much for themselves. Steadiness, sir-",CD

2080,"steadiness and keeping your eyes open, is what does it. When I say seven men",CD

2081,"and boys, I mean my mates-stokers, porters, and so forth. I don't count",CD

2082,"passengers.""",CD

2083,How did he become an engine-driver?,CD

2084,"""My father,"" he said, ""was a wheelwright in a small way, and lived in a",CD

2085,little cottage by the side of the railway which runs betwixt Leeds and Selby. It,CD

2086,"was the second railway laid down in the kingdom, the second after the",CD

2087,"Liverpool and Manchester, where Mr. Huskisson was killed, as you may have",CD

2088,"heard on, sir. When the trains rushed by, we young 'uns used to run out to look",CD

2089,"at 'em, and hooray. I noticed the driver turning handles, and making it go, and",CD

2090,"I thought to myself it would be a fine thing to be a engine-driver, and have the",CD

2091,"control of a wonderful machine like that. Before the railway, the driver of the",CD

2092,mail-coach was the biggest man I knew. I thought I should like to be the driver,CD

2093,of a coach. We had a picture in our cottage of George the Third in a red coat. I,CD

2094,"always mixed up the driver of the mail-coach-who had a red coat, too-with",CD

2095,"the king, only he had a low-crowned broad-brimmed hat, which the king",CD

2096,"hadn't. In my idea, the king couldn't be a greater man than the driver of the",CD

2097,mail-coach. I had always a fancy to be a head man of some kind. When I went,CD

2098,"to Leeds once, and saw a man conducting a orchestra, I thought I should like",CD

2099,"to be the conductor of a orchestra. When I went home I made myself a baton,",CD

2100,"and went about the fields conducting a orchestra. It wasn't there, of course, but",CD

2101,"I pretended it was. At another time, a man with a whip and a speakingtrumpet, on the stage outside a show, took my fancy, and I thought I should",CD

2102,"like to be him. But when the train came, the engine-driver put them all in the",CD

2103,"shade, and I was resolved to be a engine-driver. It wasn't long before I had to",CD

2104,"do something to earn my own living, though I was only a young 'un. My",CD

2105,father died suddenly-he was killed by thunder and lightning while standing,CD

2106,under a tree out of the rain-and mother couldn't keep us all. The day after my,CD

2107,"father's burial I walked down to the station, and said I wanted to be a enginedriver. The station-master laughed a bit, said I was for beginning early, but that",CD

2108,"I was not quite big enough yet. He gave me a penny, and told me to go home",CD

2109,"and grow, and come again in ten years' time. I didn't dream of danger then. If I",CD

2110,"couldn't be a engine-driver, I was determined to have something to do about a",CD

2111,"engine; so, as I could get nothing else, I went on board a Humber steamer, and",CD

2112,"broke up coals for the stoker. That was how I began. From that, I became a",CD

2113,"stoker, first on board a boat, and then on a locomotive. Then, after two years'",CD

2114,"service, I became a driver on the very Line which passed our cottage. My",CD

2115,"mother and my brothers and sisters came out to look at me, the first day I",CD

2116,"drove. I was watching for them and they was watching for me, and they waved",CD

2117,"their hands and hoora'd, and I waved my hand to them. I had the steam well",CD

2118,"up, and was going at a rattling pace, and rare proud I was that minute. Never",CD

2119,was so proud in my life!,CD

2120,"""When a man has a liking for a thing it's as good as being clever. In a very",CD

2121,short time I became one of the best drivers on the Line. That was allowed. I,CD

2122,"took a pride in it, you see, and liked it. No, I didn't know much about the",CD

2123,"engine scientifically, as you call it; but I could put her to rights if anything",CD

2124,"went out of gear-that is to say, if there was nothing broken-but I couldn't",CD

2125,"have explained how the steam worked inside. Starting a engine, it's just like",CD

2126,drawing a drop of gin. You turn a handle and off she goes; then you turn the,CD

2127,"handle the other way, put on the brakes, and you stop her. There's not much",CD

2128,"more in it, so far. It's no good being scientific and knowing the principle of the",CD

2129,"engine inside; no good at all. Fitters, who know all the ins and outs of the",CD

2130,"engine, make the worst drivers. That's well known. They know too much. It's",CD

2131,just as I've heard of a man with regard to his inside: if he knew what a,CD

2132,"complicated machine it is, he would never eat, or drink, or dance, or run, or do",CD

2133,"anything, for fear of busting something. So it is with fitters. But us as are not",CD

2134,"troubled with such thoughts, we go ahead.",CD

2135,"""But starting a engine's one thing and driving of her is another. Any one, a",CD

2136,"child a'most, can turn on the steam and turn it off again; but it ain't every one",CD

2137,"that can keep a engine well on the road, no more than it ain't every one who",CD

2138,can ride a horse properly. It is much the same thing. If you gallop a horse right,CD

2139,"off for a mile or two, you take the wind out of him, and for the next mile or",CD

2140,two you must let him trot or walk. So it is with a engine. If you put on too,CD

2141,"much steam, to get over the ground at the start, you exhaust the boiler, and",CD

2142,then you'll have to crawl along till your fresh water boils up. The great thing,CD

2143,"in driving, is, to go steady, never to let your water get too low, nor your fire",CD

2144,"too low. It's the same with a kettle. If you fill it up when it's about half empty,",CD

2145,it soon comes to the boil again; but if you don't fill it up until the water's,CD

2146,"nearly out, it's a long time in coming to the boil again. Another thing; you",CD

2147,"should never make spurts, unless you are detained and lose time. You should",CD

2148,go up a incline and down a incline at the same pace. Sometimes a driver will,CD

2149,"waste his steam, and when he comes to a hill he has scarcely enough to drag",CD

2150,"him up. When you're in a train that goes by fits and starts, you may be sure",CD

2151,that there is a bad driver on the engine. That kind of driving frightens,CD

2152,"passengers dreadful. When the train, after rattling along, suddenly slackens",CD

2153,"speed when it ain't near a station, it may be in the middle of a tunnel, the",CD

2154,passengers think there is danger. But generally it's because the driver has,CD

2155,exhausted his steam.,CD

2156,"""I drove the Brighton express, four or five years before I come here, and",CD

2157,"the annuals-that is, the passengers who had annual tickets-always said they",CD

2158,"knew when I was on the engine, because they wasn't jerked. Gentlemen used",CD

2159,"to say as they came on to the platform, 'Who drives to-day-Jim Martin?' And",CD

2160,"when the guard told them yes, they said 'All right,' and took their seats quite",CD

2161,comfortable. But the driver never gets so much as a shilling; the guard comes,CD

2162,"in for all that, and he does nothing much. Few ever think of the driver. I dare",CD

2163,"say they think the train goes along of itself; yet if we didn't keep a sharp lookout, know our duty, and do it, they might all go smash at any moment. I used",CD

2164,"to make that journey to Brighton in fifty-two minutes. The papers said fortynine minutes, but that was coming it a little too strong. I had to watch signals",CD

2165,"all the way, one every two miles, so that me and my stoker were on the stretch",CD

2166,"all the time, doing two things at once-attending to the engine and looking",CD

2167,"out. I've driven on this Line, eighty-one miles and three-quarters, in eighty-six",CD

2168,"minutes. There's no danger in speed if you have a good road, a good engine,",CD

2169,"and not too many coaches behind. No, we don't call them carriages, we call",CD

2170,them 'coaches.',CD

2171,"""Yes; oscillation means danger. If you're ever in a coach that oscillates",CD

2172,"much, tell of it at the first station and get it coupled up closer. Coaches when",CD

2173,"they're too loose are apt to jump, or swing off the rails; and it's quite as",CD

2174,dangerous when they're coupled up too close. There ought to be just space,CD

2175,"enough for the buffers to work easy. Passengers are frightened in tunnels, but",CD

2176,"there's less danger, now, in tunnels than anywhere else. We never enter a",CD

2177,tunnel unless it's signalled Clear.,CD

2178,"""A train can be stopped wonderful quick, even when running express, if",CD

2179,the guards act with the driver and clap on all the brakes promptly. Much,CD

2180,"depends upon the guards. One brake behind, is as good as two in front. The",CD

2181,"engine, you see, loses weight as she burns her coals and consumes her water,",CD

2182,but the coaches behind don't alter. We have a good deal of trouble with young,CD

2183,"guards. In their anxiety to perform their duties, they put on the brakes too",CD

2184,"soon, so that sometimes we can scarcely drag the train into the station; when",CD

2185,"they grow older at it they are not so anxious, and don't put them on soon",CD

2186,"enough. It's no use to say, when an accident happens, that they did not put on",CD

2187,"the brakes in time; they swear they did, and you can't prove that they didn't.",CD

2188,"""Do I think that the tapping of the wheels with a hammer is a mere",CD

2189,"ceremony? Well, I don't know exactly; I should not like to say. It's not often",CD

2190,that the chaps find anything wrong. They may sometimes be half asleep when,CD

2191,a train comes into a station in the middle of the night. You would be yourself.,CD

2192,"They ought to tap the axle-box, but they don't.",CD

2193,"""Many accidents take place that never get into the papers; many trains, full",CD

2194,"of passengers, escape being dashed to pieces by next door to a miracle.",CD

2195,Nobody knows anything about it but the driver and the stoker. I remember,CD

2196,"once, when I was driving on the Eastern Counties. Going round a curve, I",CD

2197,suddenly saw a train coming along on the same line of rails. I clapped on the,CD

2198,"brake, but it was too late, I thought. Seeing the engine almost close upon us, I",CD

2199,"cried to my stoker to jump. He jumped off the engine, almost before the words",CD

2200,"were out of my mouth. I was just taking my hand off the lever to follow, when",CD

2201,"the coming train turned off on the points, and the next instant the hind coach",CD

2202,passed my engine by a shave. It was the nearest touch I ever saw. My stoker,CD

2203,was killed. In another half second I should have jumped off and been killed,CD

2204,too. What would have become of the train without us is more than I can tell,CD

2205,you.,CD

2206,"""There are heaps of people run over, that no one ever hears about. One",CD

2207,"dark night in the Black Country, me and my mate felt something wet and",CD

2208,"warm splash in our faces. 'That didn't come from the engine, Bill,' I said.",CD

2209,"'No,' he said; 'it's something thick, Jim.' It was blood. That's what it was. We",CD

2210,heard afterwards that a collier had been run over. When we kill any of our own,CD

2211,"chaps, we say as little about it as possible. It's generally-mostly always-",CD

2212,"their own fault. No, we never think of danger ourselves. We're used to it, you",CD

2213,see. But we're not reckless. I don't believe there's any body of men that takes,CD

2214,more pride in their work than engine-drivers do. We are as proud and as fond,CD

2215,of our engines as if they were living things; as proud of them as a huntsman or,CD

2216,a jockey is of his horse. And a engine has almost as many ways as a horse;,CD

2217,"she's a kicker, a plunger, a roarer, or what not, in her way. Put a stranger on to",CD

2218,"my engine, and he wouldn't know what to do with her. Yes; there's wonderful",CD

2219,improvements in engines since the last great Exhibition. Some of them take up,CD

2220,"their water without stopping. That's a wonderful invention, and yet as simple",CD

2221,"as A B C. There are water-troughs at certain places, lying between the rails. By",CD

2222,"moving a lever you let down the mouth of a scoop into the water, and as you",CD

2223,"rush along the water is forced into the tank, at the rate of three thousand",CD

2224,gallons a minute.,CD

2225,"""A engine-driver's chief anxiety is to keep time; that's what he thinks most",CD

2226,"of. When I was driving the Brighton express, I always felt like as if I was",CD

2227,riding a race against time. I had no fear of the pace; what I feared was losing,CD

2228,"way, and not getting in to the minute. We have to give in an account of our",CD

2229,"time when we arrive. The company provides us with watches, and we go by",CD

2230,"them. Before starting on a journey, we pass through a room to be inspected.",CD

2231,"That's to see if we are sober. But they don't say nothing to us, and a man who",CD

2232,was a little gone might pass easy. I've known a stoker that had passed the,CD

2233,"inspection, come on to the engine as drunk as a fly, flop down among the",CD

2234,"coals, and sleep there like a log for the whole run. I had to be my own stoker",CD

2235,"then. If you ask me if engine-drivers are drinking men, I must answer you that",CD

2236,they are pretty well. It's trying work; one half of you cold as ice; t'other half,CD

2237,"hot as fire; wet one minute, dry the next. If ever a man had an excuse for",CD

2238,"drinking, that man's a engine-driver. And yet I don't know if ever a driver",CD

2239,"goes upon his engine drunk. If he was to, the wind would soon sober him.",CD

2240,"""I believe engine-drivers, as a body, are the healthiest fellows alive; but",CD

2241,"they don't live long. The cause of that, I believe to be the cold food, and the",CD

2242,"shaking. By the cold food, I mean that a engine-driver never gets his meals",CD

2243,comfortable. He's never at home to his dinner. When he starts away the first,CD

2244,"thing in the morning, he takes a bit of cold meat and a piece of bread with him",CD

2245,"for his dinner; and generally he has to eat it in the shed, for he mustn't leave",CD

2246,"his engine. You can understand how the jolting and shaking knocks a man up,",CD

2247,after a bit. The insurance companies won't take us at ordinary rates. We're,CD

2248,"obliged to be Foresters, or Old Friends, or that sort of thing, where they ain't",CD

2249,"so particular. The wages of a engine-driver average about eight shillings a day,",CD

2250,"but if he's a good schemer with his coals-yes, I mean if he economises his",CD

2251,coals-he's allowed so much more. Some will make from five to ten shillings,CD

2252,a week that way. I don't complain of the wages particular; but it's hard lines,CD

2253,"for such as us, to have to pay income-tax. The company gives an account of all",CD

2254,"our wages, and we have to pay. It's a shame.",CD

2255,"""Our domestic life-our life at home, you mean? Well, as to that, we don't",CD

2256,"see much of our families. I leave home at half-past seven in the morning, and",CD

2257,"don't get back again until half-past nine, or maybe later. The children are not",CD

2258,"up when I leave, and they've gone to bed again before I come home. This is",CD

2259,about my day:-Leave London at 8.45; drive for four hours and a half; cold,CD

2260,snack on the engine step; see to engine; drive back again; clean engine; report,CD

2261,"myself; and home. Twelve hours' hard and anxious work, and no comfortable",CD

2262,"victuals. Yes, our wives are anxious about us; for we never know when we go",CD

2263,"out, if we'll ever come back again. We ought to go home the minute we leave",CD

2264,"the station, and report ourselves to those that are thinking on us and depending",CD

2265,"on us; but I'm afraid we don't always. Perhaps we go first to the public-house,",CD

2266,"and perhaps you would, too, if you were in charge of a engine all day long.",CD

2267,"But the wives have a way of their own, of finding out if we're all right. They",CD

2268,"inquire among each other. 'Have you seen my Jim?' one says. 'No,' says",CD

2269,"another, 'but Jack see him coming out of the station half an hour ago.' Then",CD

2270,"she knows that her Jim's all right, and knows where to find him if she wants",CD

2271,him. It's a sad thing when any of us have to carry bad news to a mate's wife.,CD

2272,"None of us likes that job. I remember when Jack Davidge was killed, none of",CD

2273,"us could face his poor missus with the news. She had seven children, poor",CD

2274,"thing, and two of 'em, the youngest, was down with the fever. We got old Mrs.",CD

2275,Berridge-Tom Berridge's mother-to break it to her. But she knew summat,CD

2276,"was the matter, the minute the old woman went in, and, afore she spoke a",CD

2277,"word, fell down like as if she was dead. She lay all night like that, and never",CD

2278,heard from mortal lips until next morning that her Jack was killed. But she,CD

2279,knew it in her heart. It's a pitch and toss kind of a life ours!,CD

2280,"""And yet I never was nervous on a engine but once. I never think of my",CD

2281,"own life. You go in for staking that, when you begin, and you get used to the",CD

2282,risk. I never think of the passengers either. The thoughts of a engine-driver,CD

2283,"never go behind his engine. If he keeps his engine all right, the coaches behind",CD

2284,"will be all right, as far as the driver is concerned. But once I did think of the",CD

2285,"passengers. My little boy, Bill, was among them that morning. He was a poor",CD

2286,"little cripple fellow that we all loved more nor the others, because he was a",CD

2287,"cripple, and so quiet, and wise-like. He was going down to his aunt in the",CD

2288,"country, who was to take care of him for a while. We thought the country air",CD

2289,would do him good. I did think there were lives behind me that morning; at,CD

2290,"least, I thought hard of one little life that was in my hands. There were twenty",CD

2291,coaches on; my little Bill seemed to me to be in every one of 'em. My hand,CD

2292,trembled as I turned on the steam. I felt my heart thumping as we drew close,CD

2293,"to the pointsman's box; as we neared the Junction, I was all in a cold sweat. At",CD

2294,the end of the first fifty miles I was nearly eleven minutes behind time.,CD

2295,'What's the matter with you this morning?' my stoker said. 'Did you have a,CD

2296,"drop too much last night?' 'Don't speak to me, Fred,' I said, 'till we get to",CD

2297,"Peterborough; and keep a sharp look-out, there's a good fellow.' I never was so",CD

2298,thankful in my life as when I shut off steam to enter the station at,CD

2299,"Peterborough. Little Bill's aunt was waiting for him, and I saw her lift him out",CD

2300,"of the carriage. I called out to her to bring him to me, and I took him upon the",CD

2301,"engine and kissed him-ah, twenty times I should think-making him in such",CD

2302,a mess with grease and coal-dust as you never saw.,CD

2303,"""I was all right for the rest of the journey. And I do believe, sir, the",CD

2304,"passengers were safer after little Bill was gone. It would never do, you see, for",CD

2305,"engine-drivers to know too much, or to feel too much.""",CD

2306,No. 3 BRANCH LINE,CD

2307,THE COMPENSATION HOUSE,CD

2308,"""There's not a looking-glass in all the house, sir. It's some peculiar fancy",CD

2309,"of my master's. There isn't one in any single room in the house.""",CD

2310,"It was a dark and gloomy-looking building, and had been purchased by",CD

2311,this Company for an enlargement of their Goods Station. The value of the,CD

2312,"house had been referred to what was popularly called ""a compensation jury,""",CD

2313,"and the house was called, in consequence, The Compensation House. It had",CD

2314,"become the Company's property; but its tenant still remained in possession,",CD

2315,pending the commencement of active building operations. My attention was,CD

2316,originally drawn to this house because it stood directly in front of a collection,CD

2317,"of huge pieces of timber which lay near this part of the Line, and on which I",CD

2318,"sometimes sat for half an hour at a time, when I was tired by my wanderings",CD

2319,about Mugby Junction.,CD

2320,"It was square, cold, grey-looking, built of rough-hewn stone, and roofed",CD

2321,"with thin slabs of the same material. Its windows were few in number, and",CD

2322,"very small for the size of the building. In the great blank, grey broad-side,",CD

2323,there were only four windows. The entrance-door was in the middle of the,CD

2324,"house; there was a window on either side of it, and there were two more in the",CD

2325,"single story above. The blinds were all closely drawn, and, when the door was",CD

2326,"shut, the dreary building gave no sign of life or occupation.",CD

2327,"But the door was not always shut. Sometimes it was opened from within,",CD

2328,"with a great jingling of bolts and door-chains, and then a man would come",CD

2329,"forward and stand upon the door-step, snuffing the air as one might do who",CD

2330,"was ordinarily kept on rather a small allowance of that element. He was stout,",CD

2331,"thick-set, and perhaps fifty or sixty years old-a man whose hair was cut",CD

2332,"exceedingly close, who wore a large bushy beard, and whose eye had a",CD

2333,"sociable twinkle in it which was prepossessing. He was dressed, whenever I",CD

2334,"saw him, in a greenish-brown frock-coat made of some material which was",CD

2335,"not cloth, wore a waistcoat and trousers of light colour, and had a frill to his",CD

2336,"shirt-an ornament, by the way, which did not seem to go at all well with the",CD

2337,"beard, which was continually in contact with it. It was the custom of this",CD

2338,"worthy person, after standing for a short time on the threshold inhaling the air,",CD

2339,"to come forward into the road, and, after glancing at one of the upper windows",CD

2340,"in a half mechanical way, to cross over to the logs, and, leaning over the fence",CD

2341,"which guarded the railway, to look up and down the Line (it passed before the",CD

2342,house) with the air of a man accomplishing a self-imposed task of which,CD

2343,"nothing was expected to come. This done, he would cross the road again, and",CD

2344,"turning on the threshold to take a final sniff of air, disappeared once more",CD

2345,"within the house, bolting and chaining the door again as if there were no",CD

2346,probability of its being reopened for at least a week. Yet half an hour had not,CD

2347,"passed before he was out in the road again, sniffing the air and looking up and",CD

2348,down the Line as before.,CD

2349,It was not very long before I managed to scrape acquaintance with this,CD

2350,restless personage. I soon found out that my friend with the shirt-frill was the,CD

2351,"confidential servant, butler, valet, factotum, what you will, of a sick",CD

2352,"gentleman, a Mr. Oswald Strange, who had recently come to inhabit the house",CD

2353,"opposite, and concerning whose history my new acquaintance, whose name I",CD

2354,"ascertained was Masey, seemed disposed to be somewhat communicative. His",CD

2355,"master, it appeared, had come down to this place, partly for the sake of",CD

2356,"reducing his establishment-not, Mr. Masey was swift to inform me, on",CD

2357,"economical principles, but because the poor gentleman, for particular reasons,",CD

2358,wished to have few dependents about him-partly in order that he might be,CD

2359,"near his old friend, Dr. Garden, who was established in the neighbourhood,",CD

2360,and whose society and advice were necessary to Mr. Strange's life. That life,CD

2361,"was, it appeared, held by this suffering gentleman on a precarious tenure. It",CD

2362,was ebbing away fast with each passing hour. The servant already spoke of his,CD

2363,"master in the past tense, describing him to me as a young gentleman not more",CD

2364,"than five-and-thirty years of age, with a young face, as far as the features and",CD

2365,"build of it went, but with an expression which had nothing of youth about it.",CD

2366,This was the great peculiarity of the man. At a distance he looked younger,CD

2367,"than he was by many years, and strangers, at the time when he had been used",CD

2368,"to get about, always took him for a man of seven or eight-and-twenty, but they",CD

2369,changed their minds on getting nearer to him. Old Masey had a way of his,CD

2370,"own of summing up the peculiarities of his master, repeating twenty times",CD

2371,"over: ""Sir, he was Strange by name, and Strange by nature, and Strange to",CD

2372,"look at into the bargain.""",CD

2373,It was during my second or third interview with the old fellow that he,CD

2374,uttered the words quoted at the beginning of this plain narrative.,CD

2375,"""Not such a thing as a looking-glass in all the house,"" the old man said,",CD

2376,"standing beside my piece of timber, and looking across reflectively at the",CD

2377,"house opposite. ""Not one.""",CD

2378,"""In the sitting-rooms, I suppose you mean?""",CD

2379,"""No, sir, I mean sitting-rooms and bedrooms both; there isn't so much as a",CD

2380,"shaving-glass as big as the palm of your hand anywhere.""",CD

2381,"""But how is it?"" I asked. ""Why are there no looking-glasses in any of the",CD

2382,"rooms?""",CD

2383,"""Ah, sir!"" replied Masey, ""that's what none of us can ever tell. There is the",CD

2384,mystery. It's just a fancy on the part of my master. He had some strange,CD

2385,"fancies, and this was one of them. A pleasant gentleman he was to live with, as",CD

2386,"any servant could desire. A liberal gentleman, and one who gave but little",CD

2387,"trouble; always ready with a kind word, and a kind deed, too, for the matter of",CD

2388,that. There was not a house in all the parish of St. George's (in which we lived,CD

2389,before we came down here) where the servants had more holidays or a better,CD

2390,"table kept; but, for all that, he had his queer ways and his fancies, as I may call",CD

2391,"them, and this was one of them. And the point he made of it, sir,"" the old man",CD

2392,"went on; ""the extent to which that regulation was enforced, whenever a new",CD

2393,servant was engaged; and the changes in the establishment it occasioned. In,CD

2394,"hiring a new servant, the very first stipulation made, was that about the",CD

2395,"looking-glasses. It was one of my duties to explain the thing, as far as it could",CD

2396,"be explained, before any servant was taken into the house. 'You'll find it an",CD

2397,"easy place,' I used to say, 'with a liberal table, good wages, and a deal of",CD

2398,leisure; but there's one thing you must make up your mind to; you must do,CD

2399,"without looking-glasses while you're here, for there isn't one in the house,",CD

2400,"and, what's more, there never will be.'""",CD

2401,"""But how did you know there never would be one?"" I asked.",CD

2402,"""Lor' bless you, sir! If you'd seen and heard all that I'd seen and heard,",CD

2403,"you could have no doubt about it. Why, only to take one instance:-I",CD

2404,remember a particular day when my master had occasion to go into the,CD

2405,"housekeeper's room where the cook lived, to see about some alterations that",CD

2406,"were making, and when a pretty scene took place. The cook-she was a very",CD

2407,"ugly woman, and awful vain-had left a little bit of looking-glass, about six",CD

2408,"inches square, upon the chimney-piece; she had got it surreptious, and kept it",CD

2409,"always locked up; but she'd left it out, being called away suddenly, while",CD

2410,"titivating her hair. I had seen the glass, and was making for the chimney-piece",CD

2411,"as fast as I could; but master came in front of it before I could get there, and it",CD

2412,"was all over in a moment. He gave one long piercing look into it, turned",CD

2413,"deadly pale, and seizing the glass, dashed it into a hundred pieces on the floor,",CD

2414,and then stamped upon the fragments and ground them into powder with his,CD

2415,"feet. He shut himself up for the rest of that day in his own room, first ordering",CD

2416,"me to discharge the cook, then and there, at a moment's notice.""",CD

2417,"""What an extraordinary thing!"" I said, pondering.",CD

2418,"""Ah, sir,"" continued the old man, ""it was astonishing what trouble I had",CD

2419,with those women-servants. It was difficult to get any that would take the,CD

2420,place at all under the circumstances. 'What not so much as a mossul to do,CD

2421,"one's 'air at?' they would say, and they'd go off, in spite of extra wages. Then",CD

2422,"those who did consent to come, what lies they would tell, to be sure! They",CD

2423,"would protest that they didn't want to look in the glass, that they never had",CD

2424,"been in the habit of looking in the glass, and all the while that very wench",CD

2425,"would have her looking-glass of some kind or another, hid away among her",CD

2426,"clothes up-stairs. Sooner or later, she would bring it out too, and leave it about",CD

2427,"somewhere or other (just like the cook), where it was as likely as not that",CD

2428,"master might see it. And then-for girls like that have no consciences, sir-",CD

2429,"when I had caught one of 'em at it, she'd turn round as bold as brass, 'And",CD

2430,"how am I to know whether my 'air's parted straight?' she'd say, just as if it",CD

2431,hadn't been considered in her wages that that was the very thing which she,CD

2432,"never was to know while she lived in our house. A vain lot, sir, and the ugly",CD

2433,ones always the vainest. There was no end to their dodges. They'd have,CD

2434,"looking-glasses in the interiors of their workbox-lids, where it was next to",CD

2435,"impossible that I could find 'em, or inside the covers of hymn-books, or",CD

2436,"cookery-books, or in their caddies. I recollect one girl, a sly one she was, and",CD

2437,"marked with the small-pox terrible, who was always reading her prayer-book",CD

2438,"at odd times. Sometimes I used to think what a religious mind she'd got, and",CD

2439,at other times (depending on the mood I was in) I would conclude that it was,CD

2440,"the marriage-service she was studying; but one day, when I got behind her to",CD

2441,"satisfy my doubts-lo and behold! it was the old story: a bit of glass, without a",CD

2442,"frame, fastened into the kiver with the outside edges of the sheets of postagestamps. Dodges! Why they'd keep their looking-glasses in the scullery or the",CD

2443,"coal-cellar, or leave them in charge of the servants next door, or with the milkwoman round the corner; but have 'em they would. And I don't mind",CD

2444,"confessing, sir,"" said the old man, bringing his long speech to an end, ""that it",CD

2445,was an inconveniency not to have so much as a scrap to shave before. I used to,CD

2446,"go to the barber's at first, but I soon gave that up, and took to wearing my",CD

2447,"beard as my master did; likewise to keeping my hair""-Mr. Masey touched his",CD

2448,"head as he spoke-""so short, that it didn't require any parting, before or",CD

2449,"behind.""",CD

2450,"I sat for some time lost in amazement, and staring at my companion. My",CD

2451,"curiosity was powerfully stimulated, and the desire to learn more was very",CD

2452,strong within me.,CD

2453,"""Had your master any personal defect,"" I inquired, ""which might have",CD

2454,"made it distressing to him to see his own image reflected?""",CD

2455,"""By no means, sir,"" said the old man. ""He was as handsome a gentleman",CD

2456,"as you would wish to see: a little delicate-looking and careworn, perhaps, with",CD

2457,"a very pale face; but as free from any deformity as you or I, sir. No, sir, no; it",CD

2458,"was nothing of that.""",CD

2459,"""Then what was it? What is it?"" I asked, desperately. ""Is there no one who",CD

2460,"is, or has been, in your master's confidence?""",CD

2461,"""Yes, sir,"" said the old fellow, with his eyes turning to that window",CD

2462,"opposite. ""There is one person who knows all my master's secrets, and this",CD

2463,"secret among the rest.""",CD

2464,"""And who is that?""",CD

2465,"The old man turned round and looked at me fixedly. ""The doctor here,"" he",CD

2466,"said. ""Dr. Garden. My master's very old friend.""",CD

2467,"""I should like to speak with this gentleman,"" I said, involuntarily.",CD

2468,"""He is with my master now,"" answered Masey. ""He will be coming out",CD

2469,"presently, and I think I may say he will answer any question you may like to",CD

2470,"put to him."" As the old man spoke, the door of the house opened, and a",CD

2471,"middle-aged gentleman, who was tall and thin, but who lost something of his",CD

2472,"height by a habit of stooping, appeared on the step. Old Masey left me in a",CD

2473,"moment. He muttered something about taking the doctor's directions, and",CD

2474,hastened across the road. The tall gentleman spoke to him for a minute or two,CD

2475,"very seriously, probably about the patient up-stairs, and it then seemed to me",CD

2476,from their gestures that I myself was the subject of some further conversation,CD

2477,"between them. At all events, when old Masey retired into the house, the doctor",CD

2478,"came across to where I was standing, and addressed me with a very agreeable",CD

2479,smile.,CD

2480,"""John Masey tells me that you are interested in the case of my poor friend,",CD

2481,"sir. I am now going back to my house, and if you don't mind the trouble of",CD

2482,"walking with me, I shall be happy to enlighten you as far as I am able.""",CD

2483,"I hastened to make my apologies and express my acknowledgments, and",CD

2484,we set off together. When we had reached the doctor's house and were seated,CD

2485,"in his study, I ventured to inquire after the health of this poor gentleman.",CD

2486,"""I am afraid there is no amendment, nor any prospect of amendment,"" said",CD

2487,"the doctor. ""Old Masey has told you something of his strange condition, has he",CD

2488,"not?""",CD

2489,"""Yes, he has told me something,"" I answered, ""and he says you know all",CD

2490,"about it.""",CD

2491,"Dr. Garden looked very grave. ""I don't know all about it. I only know what",CD

2492,happens when he comes into the presence of a looking-glass. But as to the,CD

2493,circumstances which have led to his being haunted in the strangest fashion that,CD

2494,"I ever heard of, I know no more of them than you do.""",CD

2495,"""Haunted?"" I repeated. ""And in the strangest fashion that you ever heard",CD

2496,"of?""",CD

2497,"Dr. Garden smiled at my eagerness, seemed to be collecting his thoughts,",CD

2498,and presently went on:,CD

2499,"""I made the acquaintance of Mr. Oswald Strange in a curious way. It was",CD

2500,"on board of an Italian steamer, bound from Civita Vecchia to Marseilles. We",CD

2501,"had been travelling all night. In the morning I was shaving myself in the cabin,",CD

2502,"when suddenly this man came behind me, glanced for a moment into the small",CD

2503,"mirror before which I was standing, and then, without a word of warning, tore",CD

2504,"it from the nail, and dashed it to pieces at my feet. His face was at first livid",CD

2505,with passion-it seemed to me rather the passion of fear than of anger-but it,CD

2506,"changed after a moment, and he seemed ashamed of what he had done. Well,""",CD

2507,"continued the doctor, relapsing for a moment into a smile, ""of course I was in",CD

2508,"a devil of a rage. I was operating on my under-jaw, and the start the thing gave",CD

2509,"me caused me to cut myself. Besides, altogether it seemed an outrageous and",CD

2510,"insolent thing, and I gave it to poor Strange in a style of language which I am",CD

2511,"sorry to think of now, but which, I hope, was excusable at the time. As to the",CD

2512,"offender himself, his confusion and regret, now that his passion was at an end,",CD

2513,"disarmed me. He sent for the steward, and paid most liberally for the damage",CD

2514,"done to the steam-boat property, explaining to him, and to some other",CD

2515,"passengers who were present in the cabin, that what had happened had been",CD

2516,"accidental. For me, however, he had another explanation. Perhaps he felt that I",CD

2517,must know it to have been no accident-perhaps he really wished to confide in,CD

2518,"some one. At all events, he owned to me that what he had done was done",CD

2519,"under the influence of an uncontrollable impulse-a seizure which took him,",CD

2520,"he said, at times-something like a fit. He begged my pardon, and entreated",CD

2521,"that I would endeavour to disassociate him personally from this action, of",CD

2522,"which he was heartily ashamed. Then he attempted a sickly joke, poor fellow,",CD

2523,"about his wearing a beard, and feeling a little spiteful, in consequence, when",CD

2524,he saw other people taking the trouble to shave; but he said nothing about any,CD

2525,"infirmity or delusion, and shortly after left me.",CD

2526,"""In my professional capacity I could not help taking some interest in Mr.",CD

2527,Strange. I did not altogether lose sight of him after our sea-journey to,CD

2528,Marseilles was over. I found him a pleasant companion up to a certain point;,CD

2529,but I always felt that there was a reserve about him. He was uncommunicative,CD

2530,"about his past life, and especially would never allude to anything connected",CD

2531,"with his travels or his residence in Italy, which, however, I could make out had",CD

2532,"been a long one. He spoke Italian well, and seemed familiar with the country,",CD

2533,but disliked to talk about it.,CD

2534,"""During the time we spent together there were seasons when he was so",CD

2535,"little himself, that I, with a pretty large experience, was almost afraid to be",CD

2536,with him. His attacks were violent and sudden in the last degree; and there was,CD

2537,one most extraordinary feature connected with them all:-some horrible,CD

2538,association of ideas took possession of him whenever he found himself before,CD

2539,"a looking-glass. And after we had travelled together for a time, I dreaded the",CD

2540,"sight of a mirror hanging harmlessly against a wall, or a toilet-glass standing",CD

2541,"on a dressing-table, almost as much as he did.",CD

2542,"""Poor Strange was not always affected in the same manner by a lookingglass. Sometimes it seemed to madden him with fury; at other times, it",CD

2543,appeared to turn him to stone: remaining motionless and speechless as if,CD

2544,"attacked by catalepsy. One night-the worst things always happen at night,",CD

2545,and oftener than one would think on stormy nights-we arrived at a small,CD

2546,"town in the central district of Auvergne: a place but little known, out of the",CD

2547,"line of railways, and to which we had been drawn, partly by the antiquarian",CD

2548,"attractions which the place possessed, and partly by the beauty of the scenery.",CD

2549,"The weather had been rather against us. The day had been dull and murky, the",CD

2550,"heat stifling, and the sky had threatened mischief since the morning. At",CD

2551,"sundown, these threats were fulfilled. The thunderstorm, which had been all",CD

2552,"day coming up-as it seemed to us, against the wind-burst over the place",CD

2553,"where we were lodged, with very great violence.",CD

2554,"""There are some practical-minded persons with strong constitutions, who",CD

2555,"deny roundly that their fellow-creatures are, or can be, affected, in mind or",CD

2556,"body, by atmospheric influences. I am not a disciple of that school, simply",CD

2557,"because I cannot believe that those changes of weather, which have so much",CD

2558,"effect upon animals, and even on inanimate objects, can fail to have some",CD

2559,influence on a piece of machinery so sensitive and intricate as the human,CD

2560,"frame. I think, then, that it was in part owing to the disturbed state of the",CD

2561,"atmosphere that, on this particular evening I felt nervous and depressed. When",CD

2562,"my new friend Strange and I parted for the night, I felt as little disposed to go",CD

2563,to rest as I ever did in my life. The thunder was still lingering among the,CD

2564,mountains in the midst of which our inn was placed. Sometimes it seemed,CD

2565,"nearer, and at other times further off; but it never left off altogether, except for",CD

2566,a few minutes at a time. I was quite unable to shake off a succession of painful,CD

2567,ideas which persistently besieged my mind.,CD

2568,"""It is hardly necessary to add that I thought from time to time of my",CD

2569,travelling-companion in the next room. His image was almost continually,CD

2570,"before me. He had been dull and depressed all the evening, and when we",CD

2571,parted for the night there was a look in his eyes which I could not get out of,CD

2572,my memory.,CD

2573,"""There was a door between our rooms, and the partition dividing them was",CD

2574,not very solid; and yet I had heard no sound since I parted from him which,CD

2575,"could indicate that he was there at all, much less that he was awake and",CD

2576,"stirring. I was in a mood, sir, which made this silence terrible to me, and so",CD

2577,"many foolish fancies-as that he was lying there dead, or in a fit, or what not",CD

2578,"-took possession of me, that at last I could bear it no longer. I went to the",CD

2579,"door, and, after listening, very attentively but quite in vain, for any sound, I at",CD

2580,last knocked pretty sharply. There was no answer. Feeling that longer suspense,CD

2581,"would be unendurable, I, without more ceremony, turned the handle and went",CD

2582,in.,CD

2583,"""It was a great bare room, and so imperfectly lighted by a single candle",CD

2584,that it was almost impossible-except when the lightning flashed-to see into,CD

2585,"its great dark corners. A small rickety bedstead stood against one of the walls,",CD

2586,"shrouded by yellow cotton curtains, passed through a great iron ring in the",CD

2587,"ceiling. There was, for all other furniture, an old chest of drawers which",CD

2588,"served also as a washing-stand, having a small basin and ewer and a single",CD

2589,"towel arranged on the top of it. There were, moreover, two ancient chairs and a",CD

2590,"dressing-table. On this last, stood a large old-fashioned looking-glass with a",CD

2591,carved frame.,CD

2592,"""I must have seen all these things, because I remember them so well now,",CD

2593,"but I do not know how I could have seen them, for it seems to me that, from",CD

2594,"the moment of my entering that room, the action of my senses and of the",CD

2595,faculties of my mind was held fast by the ghastly figure which stood,CD

2596,motionless before the looking-glass in the middle of the empty room.,CD

2597,"""How terrible it was! The weak light of one candle standing on the table",CD

2598,"shone upon Strange's face, lighting it from below, and throwing (as I now",CD

2599,"remember) his shadow, vast and black, upon the wall behind him and upon the",CD

2600,"ceiling overhead. He was leaning rather forward, with his hands upon the table",CD

2601,"supporting him, and gazing into the glass which stood before him with a",CD

2602,horrible fixity. The sweat was on his white face; his rigid features and his pale,CD

2603,"lips showed in that feeble light were horrible, more than words can tell, to look",CD

2604,"at. He was so completely stupefied and lost, that the noise I had made in",CD

2605,knocking and in entering the room was unobserved by him. Not even when I,CD

2606,called him loudly by name did he move or did his face change.,CD

2607,"""What a vision of horror that was, in the great dark empty room, in a",CD

2608,"silence that was something more than negative, that ghastly figure frozen into",CD

2609,stone by some unexplained terror! And the silence and the stillness! The very,CD

2610,"thunder had ceased now. My heart stood still with fear. Then, moved by some",CD

2611,"instinctive feeling, under whose influence I acted mechanically, I crept with",CD

2612,"slow steps nearer and nearer to the table, and at last, half expecting to see",CD

2613,"some spectre even more horrible than this which I saw already, I looked over",CD

2614,"his shoulder into the looking-glass. I happened to touch his arm, though only",CD

2615,in the lightest manner. In that one moment the spell which had held him-who,CD

2616,"knows how long?-enchained, seemed broken, and he lived in this world",CD

2617,"again. He turned round upon me, as suddenly as a tiger makes its spring, and",CD

2618,seized me by the arm.,CD

2619,"""I have told you that even before I entered my friend's room I had felt, all",CD

2620,"that night, depressed and nervous. The necessity for action at this time was,",CD

2621,"however, so obvious, and this man's agony made all that I had felt, appear so",CD

2622,"trifling, that much of my own discomfort seemed to leave me. I felt that I must",CD

2623,be strong.,CD

2624,"""The face before me almost unmanned me. The eyes which looked into",CD

2625,"mine were so scared with terror, the lips-if I may say so-looked so",CD

2626,"speechless. The wretched man gazed long into my face, and then, still holding",CD

2627,"me by the arm, slowly, very slowly, turned his head. I had gently tried to move",CD

2628,"him away from the looking-glass, but he would not stir, and now he was",CD

2629,"looking into it as fixedly as ever. I could bear this no longer, and, using such",CD

2630,"force as was necessary, I drew him gradually away, and got him to one of the",CD

2631,"chairs at the foot of the bed. 'Come!' I said-after the long silence my voice,",CD

2632,"even to myself, sounded strange and hollow-'come! You are over-tired, and",CD

2633,you feel the weather. Don't you think you ought to be in bed? Suppose you lie,CD

2634,down. Let me try my medical skill in mixing you a composing draught.',CD

2635,"""He held my hand, and looked eagerly into my eyes. 'I am better now,' he",CD

2636,"said, speaking at last very faintly. Still he looked at me in that wistful way. It",CD

2637,"seemed as if there were something that he wanted to do or say, but had not",CD

2638,sufficient resolution. At length he got up from the chair to which I had led,CD

2639,"him, and beckoning me to follow him, went across the room to the dressingtable, and stood again before the glass. A violent shudder passed through his",CD

2640,frame as he looked into it; but apparently forcing himself to go through with,CD

2641,"what he had now begun, he remained where he was, and, without looking",CD

2642,"away, moved to me with his hand to come and stand beside him. I complied.",CD

2643,"""'Look in there!' he said, in an almost inaudible tone. He was supported,",CD

2644,"as before, by his hands resting on the table, and could only bow with his head",CD

2645,towards the glass to intimate what he meant. 'Look in there!' he repeated.,CD

2646,"""I did as he asked me.",CD

2647,"""'What do you see?' he asked next.",CD

2648,"""'See?' I repeated, trying to speak as cheerfully as I could, and describing",CD

2649,"the reflexion of his own face as nearly as I could. 'I see a very, very pale face",CD

2650,with sunken cheeks-',CD

2651,"""'What?' he cried, with an alarm in his voice which I could not understand.",CD

2652,"""'With sunken cheeks,' I went on, 'and two hollow eyes with large pupils.'",CD

2653,"""I saw the reflexion of my friend's face change, and felt his hand clutch",CD

2654,my arm even more tightly than he had done before. I stopped abruptly and,CD

2655,"looked round at him. He did not turn his head towards me, but, gazing still into",CD

2656,"the looking-glass, seemed to labour for utterance.",CD

2657,"""'What,' he stammered at last. 'Do you-see it-too?'",CD

2658,"""'See what?' I asked, quickly.",CD

2659,"""'That face!' he cried, in accents of horror. 'That face-which is not mine",CD

2660,-and which-I see instead of mine-always!',CD

2661,"""I was struck speechless by the words. In a moment this mystery was",CD

2662,"explained-but what an explanation! Worse, a hundred times worse, than",CD

2663,anything I had imagined. What! Had this man lost the power of seeing his own,CD

2664,"image as it was reflected there before him? and, in its place, was there the",CD

2665,image of another? Had he changed reflexions with some other man? The,CD

2666,frightfulness of the thought struck me speechless for a time-then I saw how,CD

2667,false an impression my silence was conveying.,CD

2668,"""'No, no, no!' I cried, as soon as I could speak-'a hundred times, no! I",CD

2669,"see you, of course, and only you. It was your face I attempted to describe, and",CD

2670,no other.',CD

2671,"""He seemed not to hear me. 'Why, look there!' he said, in a low, indistinct",CD

2672,"voice, pointing to his own image in the glass. 'Whose face do you see there?'",CD

2673,"""'Why yours, of course.' And then, after a moment, I added, 'Whose do",CD

2674,you see?',CD

2675,"""He answered, like one in a trance, 'His-only his-always his!' He stood",CD

2676,"still a moment, and then, with a loud and terrific scream, repeated those words,",CD

2677,"'Always his, always his,' and fell down in a fit before me.",CD

2678,"""I knew what to do now. Here was a thing which, at any rate, I could",CD

2679,understand. I had with me my usual small stock of medicines and surgical,CD

2680,"instruments, and I did what was necessary: first to restore my unhappy patient,",CD

2681,and next to procure for him the rest he needed so much. He was very ill-at,CD

2682,"death's door for some days-and I could not leave him, though there was",CD

2683,"urgent need that I should be back in London. When he began to mend, I sent",CD

2684,over to England for my servant-John Masey-whom I knew I could trust.,CD

2685,"Acquainting him with the outlines of the case, I left him in charge of my",CD

2686,"patient, with orders that he should be brought over to this country as soon as",CD

2687,he was fit to travel.,CD

2688,"""That awful scene was always before me. I saw this devoted man day after",CD

2689,"day, with the eyes of my imagination, sometimes destroying in his rage the",CD

2690,"harmless looking-glass, which was the immediate cause of his suffering,",CD

2691,sometimes transfixed before the horrid image that turned him to stone. I,CD

2692,"recollect coming upon him once when we were stopping at a roadside inn, and",CD

2693,"seeing him stand so by broad daylight. His back was turned towards me, and I",CD

2694,waited and watched him for nearly half an hour as he stood there motionless,CD

2695,"and speechless, and appearing not to breathe. I am not sure but that this",CD

2696,apparition seen so by daylight was more ghastly than that apparition seen in,CD

2697,"the middle of the night, with the thunder rumbling among the hills.",CD

2698,"""Back in London in his own house, where he could command in some sort",CD

2699,"the objects which should surround him, poor Strange was better than he would",CD

2700,"have been elsewhere. He seldom went out except at night, but once or twice I",CD

2701,"have walked with him by daylight, and have seen him terribly agitated when",CD

2702,we have had to pass a shop in which looking-glasses were exposed for sale.,CD

2703,"""It is nearly a year now since my poor friend followed me down to this",CD

2705,"weaker and weaker, and a disease of the lungs has become developed in him,",CD

2706,"which has brought him to his death-bed. I should add, by-the-by, that John",CD

2707,"Masey has been his constant companion ever since I brought them together,",CD

2708,"and I have had, consequently, to look after a new servant.",CD

2709,"""And now tell me,"" the doctor added, bringing his tale to an end, ""did you",CD

2710,"ever hear a more miserable history, or was ever man haunted in a more ghastly",CD

2711,"manner than this man?""",CD

2712,"I was about to reply when I heard a sound of footsteps outside, and before",CD

2713,"I could speak old Masey entered the room, in haste and disorder.",CD

2714,"""I was just telling this gentleman,"" the doctor said: not at the moment",CD

2715,"observing old Masey's changed manner: ""how you deserted me to go over to",CD

2716,"your present master.""",CD

2717,"""Ah! sir,"" the man answered, in a troubled voice, ""I'm afraid he won't be",CD

2718,"my master long.""",CD

2719,"The doctor was on his legs in a moment. ""What! Is he worse?""",CD

2720,"""I think, sir, he is dying,"" said the old man.",CD

2721,"""Come with me, sir; you may be of use if you can keep quiet."" The doctor",CD

2722,"caught up his hat as he addressed me in those words, and in a few minutes we",CD

2723,"had reached The Compensation House. A few seconds more, and we were",CD

2724,"standing in a darkened room on the first floor, and I saw lying on a bed before",CD

2725,"me-pale, emaciated, and, as it seemed, dying-the man whose story I had",CD

2726,just heard.,CD

2727,"He was lying with closed eyes when we came into the room, and I had",CD

2728,leisure to examine his features. What a tale of misery they told! They were,CD

2729,"regular and symmetrical in their arrangement, and not without beauty-the",CD

2730,"beauty of exceeding refinement and delicacy. Force there was none, and",CD

2731,perhaps it was to the want of this that the faults-perhaps the crime-which,CD

2732,had made the man's life so miserable were to be attributed. Perhaps the crime?,CD

2733,"Yes, it was not likely that an affliction, lifelong and terrible, such as this he",CD

2734,"had endured, would come upon him unless some misdeed had provoked the",CD

2735,punishment. What misdeed we were soon to know.,CD

2736,It sometimes-I think generally-happens that the presence of any one,CD

2737,"who stands and watches beside a sleeping man will wake him, unless his",CD

2738,"slumbers are unusually heavy. It was so now. While we looked at him, the",CD

2739,"sleeper awoke very suddenly, and fixed his eyes upon us. He put out his hand",CD

2740,"and took the doctor's in its feeble grasp. ""Who is that?"" he asked next,",CD

2741,pointing towards me.,CD

2742,"""Do you wish him to go? The gentleman knows something of your",CD

2743,"sufferings, and is powerfully interested in your case; but he will leave us, if",CD

2744,"you wish it,"" the doctor said.",CD

2745,"""No. Let him stay.""",CD

2746,"Seating myself out of sight, but where I could both see and hear what",CD

2747,"passed, I waited for what should follow. Dr. Garden and John Masey stood",CD

2748,beside the bed. There was a moment's pause.,CD

2749,"""I want a looking-glass,"" said Strange, without a word of preface.",CD

2752,Doctor Garden whispered to old Masey; and the latter left the room. He,CD

2753,"was not absent long, having gone no further than the next house. He held an",CD

2754,oval-framed mirror in his hand when he returned. A shudder passed through,CD

2755,the body of the sick man as he saw it.,CD

2756,"""Put it down,"" he said, faintly-""anywhere-for the present.""",CD

2757,"No one of us spoke. I do not think, in that moment of suspense, that we",CD

2758,"could, any of us, have spoken if we had tried.",CD

2759,"The sick man tried to raise himself a little. ""Prop me up,"" he said. ""I speak",CD

2760,"with difficulty-I have something to say.""",CD

2761,"They put pillows behind him, so as to raise his head and body.",CD

2762,"""I have presently a use for it,"" he said, indicating the mirror. ""I want to see",CD

2763,"-"" He stopped, and seemed to change his mind. He was sparing of his words.",CD

2764,"""I want to tell you-all about it."" Again he was silent. Then he seemed to",CD

2765,"make a great effort and spoke once more, beginning very abruptly.",CD

2766,"""I loved my wife fondly. I loved her-her name was Lucy. She was",CD

2767,"English; but, after we were married, we lived long abroad-in Italy. She liked",CD

2768,"the country, and I liked what she liked. She liked to draw, too, and I got her a",CD

2769,master. He was an Italian. I will not give his name. We always called him 'the,CD

2770,"Master.' A treacherous insidious man this was, and, under cover of his",CD

2771,"profession, took advantage of his opportunities, and taught my wife to love",CD

2772,him-to love him.,CD

2773,"""I am short of breath. I need not enter into details as to how I found them",CD

2774,out; but I did find them out. We were away on a sketching expedition when I,CD

2775,"made my discovery. My rage maddened me, and there was one at hand who",CD

2776,"fomented my madness. My wife had a maid, who, it seemed, had also loved",CD

2777,this man-the Master-and had been ill treated and deserted by him. She told,CD

2778,me all. She had played the part of go-between-had carried letters. When she,CD

2779,"told me these things, it was night, in a solitary Italian town, among the",CD

2784,"woman said, 'He is writing to your wife,' I laid hold of my pistols, as by an",CD

2785,"instinct. It has been some comfort to me since, that I took them both. Perhaps,",CD

2786,"at that moment, I may have meant fairly by him-meant that we should fight. I",CD

2787,"don't know what I meant, quite. The woman's words, 'He is in his own room",CD

2788,"now, writing to her,' rung in my ears.""",CD

2789,"The sick man stopped to take breath. It seemed an hour, though it was",CD

2790,"probably not more than two minutes, before he spoke again.",CD

2791,"""I managed to get into his room unobserved. Indeed, he was altogether",CD

2792,"absorbed in what he was doing. He was sitting at the only table in the room,",CD

2795,was a looking-glass.,CD

2796,"""I stole up behind him as he sat and wrote by the light of the candle. I",CD

2798,"darling.' As I read the words, I pulled the trigger of the pistol I held in my",CD

2799,"right hand, and killed him-killed him-but, before he died, he looked up",CD

2800,"once-not at me, but at my image before him in the glass, and his face-such",CD

2801,"a face-has been there-ever since, and mine-my face-is gone!""",CD

2802,"He fell back exhausted, and we all pressed forward thinking that he must",CD

2803,"be dead, he lay so still.",CD

2804,But he had not yet passed away. He revived under the influence of,CD

2805,"stimulants. He tried to speak, and muttered indistinctly from time to time",CD

2806,"words of which we could sometimes make no sense. We understood, however,",CD

2807,"that he had been tried by an Italian tribunal, and had been found guilty; but",CD

2808,with such extenuating circumstances that his sentence was commuted to,CD

2809,"imprisonment, during, we thought we made out, two years. But we could not",CD

2810,"understand what he said about his wife, though we gathered that she was still",CD

2811,"alive, from something he whispered to the doctor of there being provision",CD

2812,made for her in his will.,CD

2813,"He lay in a doze for something more than an hour after he had told his tale,",CD

2816,looking-glass.,CD

2817,"""I want it,"" he said, hastily; but I noticed that he did not shudder now, as it",CD

2818,"was brought near. When old Masey approached, holding it in his hand, and",CD

2838,THE TRAVELLING POST-OFFICE,CD

2839,"Many years ago, and before this Line was so much as projected, I was",CD

2840,engaged as a clerk in a Travelling Post-office running along the Line of,CD

2841,"railway from London to a town in the Midland Counties, which we will call",CD

2842,Fazeley. My duties were to accompany the mail-train which left Fazeley at,CD

2843,"8.15 p.m., and arrived in London about midnight, and to return by the day mail",CD

2844,"leaving London at 10.30 the following morning, after which I had an unbroken",CD

2845,"night at Fazeley, while another clerk discharged the same round of work; and",CD

2846,in this way each alternative evening I was on duty in the railway post-office,CD

2847,van. At first I suffered a little from a hurry and tremor of nerve in pursuing my,CD

2848,occupation while the train was crashing along under bridges and through,CD

2849,tunnels at a speed which was then thought marvellous and perilous; but it was,CD

2850,not long before my hands and eyes became accustomed to the motion of the,CD

2851,"carriage, and I could go through my business with the same despatch and ease",CD

2852,"as in the post-office of the country town where I had learned it, and from",CD

2853,"which I had been promoted by the influence of the surveyor of the district, Mr.",CD

2854,"Huntingdon. In fact, the work soon fell into a monotonous routine, which,",CD

2855,"night after night, was pursued in an unbroken course by myself and the junior",CD

2856,"clerk, who was my only assistant: the railway post-office work not having then",CD

2857,attained the importance and magnitude it now possesses.,CD

2858,"Our route lay through an agricultural district containing many small towns,",CD

2859,which made up two or three bags only; one for London; another perhaps for,CD

2860,"the county town; a third for the railway post-office, to be opened by us, and",CD

2861,the enclosures to be distributed according to their various addresses. The,CD

2862,"clerks in many of these small offices were women, as is very generally the",CD

2863,"case still, being the daughters and female relatives of the nominal postmaster,",CD

2864,"who transact most of the business of the office, and whose names are most",CD

2865,"frequently signed upon the bills accompanying the bags. I was a young man,",CD

2866,and somewhat more curious in feminine handwriting than I am now. There,CD

2867,"was one family in particular, whom I had never seen, but with whose",CD

2868,"signatures I was perfectly familiar-clear, delicate, and educated, very unlike",CD

2869,"the miserable scrawl upon other letter-bills. One New Year's-eve, in a moment",CD

2870,"of sentiment, I tied a slip of paper among a bundle of letters for their office,",CD

2871,"upon which I had written, ""A happy New Year to you all."" The next evening",CD

2872,"brought me a return of my good wishes, signed, as I guessed, by three sisters",CD

2873,"of the name of Clifton. From that day, every now and then, a sentence or two",CD

2874,"as brief as the one above passed between us, and the feeling of acquaintance",CD

2887,to me. It was very similar in size and shape to the old-fashioned workboxes,CD

2888,used by ladies before boxes of polished and ornamental wood came into,CD

2889,"vogue, and, like them, it was covered with red morocco leather, and it fastened",CD

2890,with a lock and key. The first time it came into my hands I took such special,CD

2891,notice of it as might be expected. Upon one corner of the lid I detected a,CD

2892,"peculiar device scratched slightly upon it, most probably with the sharp point",CD

2893,"of a steel pen, in such a moment of preoccupation of mind as causes most of",CD

2894,us to draw odd lines and caricatured faces upon any piece of paper which may,CD

2895,lie under our hand. It was the old revolutionary device of a heart with a dagger,CD

2896,"piercing it; and I wondered whether it could be the Premier, or one of his",CD

2897,"secretaries, who had traced it upon the morocco.",CD

2898,"This box had been travelling up and down for about ten days, and, as the",CD

2899,"village did not make up a bag for London, there being very few letters",CD

2900,"excepting those from the great house, the letter-bag from the house, and the",CD

2901,"despatch-box, were handed direct into our travelling post-office. But in",CD

2902,"compliment to the presence of the Premier in the neighbourhood, the train,",CD

2903,"instead of slackening speed only, stopped altogether, in order that the",CD

2904,Premier's trusty and confidential messenger might deliver the important box,CD

2905,"into my own hands, that its perfect safety might be ensured. I had an undefined",CD

2906,suspicion that some person was also employed to accompany the train up to,CD

2907,"London, for three or four times I had met with a foreign-looking gentleman at",CD

2908,"Euston-square, standing at the door of the carriage nearest the post-office van,",CD

2909,and eyeing the heavy bags as they were transferred from my care to the,CD

2910,custody of the officials from the General Post-office. But though I felt amused,CD

2911,"and somewhat nettled at this needless precaution, I took no further notice of",CD

2912,"the man, except to observe that he had the swarthy aspect of a foreigner, and",CD

2913,that he kept his face well away from the light of the lamps. Except for these,CD

2914,"things, and after the first time or two, the Premier's despatch-box interested",CD

2915,me no more than any other part of my charge. My work had been doubly,CD

2916,"monotonous for some time past, and I began to think it time to get up some",CD

2917,"little entertainment with my unknown friends, the Cliftons. I was just thinking",CD

2918,of it as the train stopped at the station about a mile from the town where they,CD

2919,"lived, and their postman, a gruff matter-of-fact fellow-you could see it in",CD

2920,"every line of his face-put in the letter-bags, and with them a letter addressed",CD

2921,"to me. It was in an official envelope, ""On Her Majesty's Service,"" and the seal",CD

2922,was an official seal. On the folded paper inside it (folded officially also) I read,CD

2923,"the following order: ""Mr. Wilcox is requested to permit the bearer, the",CD

2924,"daughter of the postmaster at Eaton, to see the working of the railway postoffice during the up-journey."" The writing I knew well as being that of one of",CD

2925,"the surveyor's clerks, and the signature was Mr. Huntingdon's. The bearer of",CD

2926,"the order presented herself at the door, the snorting of the engine gave notice",CD

2927,"of the instant departure of the train, I held out my hand, the young lady sprang",CD

2928,"lightly and deftly into the van, and we were off again on our midnight journey.",CD

2929,"She was a small slight creature, one of those slender little girls one never",CD

2930,"thinks of as being a woman, dressed neatly and plainly in a dark dress, with a",CD

2931,veil hanging a little over her face and tied under her chin: the most noticeable,CD

2932,"thing about her appearance being a great mass of light hair, almost yellow,",CD

2933,"which had got loose in some way, and fell down her neck in thick wavy",CD

2934,"tresses. She had a free pleasant way about her, not in the least bold or forward,",CD

2935,which in a minute or two made her presence seem the most natural thing in the,CD

2936,world. As she stood beside me before the row of boxes into which I was,CD

2937,"sorting my letters, she asked questions and I answered as if it were quite an",CD

2938,every-day occurrence for us to be travelling up together in the night mail to,CD

2939,Euston-square station. I blamed myself for an idiot that I had not sooner made,CD

2940,an opportunity for visiting my unknown friends at Eaton.,CD

2941,"""Then,"" I said, putting down the letter-bill from their own office before",CD

2942,"her, ""may I ask which of the signatures I know so well, is yours? Is it A.",CD

2943,"Clifton, or M. Clifton, or S. Clifton?"" She hesitated a little, and blushed, and",CD

2944,lifted up her frank childlike eyes to mine.,CD

2945,"""I am A. Clifton,"" she answered.",CD

2946,"""And your name?"" I said.",CD

2947,"""Anne;"" then, as if anxious to give some explanation to me of her present",CD

2948,"position, she added, ""I was going up to London on a visit, and I thought it",CD

2949,"would be so nice to travel in the post-office to see how the work was done,",CD

2950,"and Mr. Huntingdon came to survey our office, and he said he would send me",CD

2951,"an order.""",CD

2952,"I felt somewhat surprised, for a stricter martinet than Mr. Huntingdon did",CD

2953,"not breathe; but I glanced down at the small innocent face at my side, and",CD

2954,cordially approved of his departure from ordinary rules.,CD

2955,"""Did you know you would travel with me?"" I asked, in a lower voice; for",CD

2956,"Tom Morville, my junior, was at my other elbow.",CD

2957,"""I knew I should travel with Mr. Wilcox,"" she answered, with a smile that",CD

2958,made all my nerves tingle.,CD

2959,"""You have not written me a word for ages,"" said I, reproachfully.",CD

2960,"""You had better not talk, or you'll be making mistakes,"" she replied, in an",CD

2961,"arch tone. It was quite true; for, a sudden confusion coming over me, I was",CD

2962,sorting the letters at random.,CD

2963,We were just then approaching the small station where the letter-bag from,CD

2964,the great house was taken up. The engine was slackening speed. Miss Clifton,CD

2965,manifested some natural and becoming diffidence.,CD

2966,"""It would look so odd,"" she said, ""to any one on the platform, to see a girl",CD

2967,"in the post-office van! And they couldn't know I was a postmaster's daughter,",CD

2968,"and had an order from Mr. Huntingdon. Is there no dark corner to shelter me?""",CD

2969,"I must explain to you in a word or two the construction of the van, which",CD

2970,was much less efficiently fitted up than the travelling post-offices of the,CD

2971,"present day. It was a reversible van, with a door at each right-hand corner. At",CD

2972,each door the letter-boxes were so arranged as to form a kind of screen about,CD

2973,"two feet in width, which prevented people from seeing all over the carriage at",CD

2974,"once. Thus the door at the far end of the van, the one not in use at the time,",CD

2975,"was thrown into deep shadow, and the screen before it turned it into a small",CD

2976,"niche, where a slight little person like Miss Clifton was very well concealed",CD

2977,from curious eyes. Before the train came within the light from the lamps on,CD

2978,"the platform, she ensconced herself in this shelter. No one but I could see her",CD

2979,"laughing face, as she stood there leaning cautiously forward with her finger",CD

2980,"pressed upon her rosy lips, peeping at the messenger who delivered into my",CD

2981,"own hands the Premier's despatch-box, while Tom Morville received the",CD

2982,letter-bag of the great house.,CD

2983,"""See,"" I said, when we were again in motion, and she had emerged from",CD

2984,"her concealment, ""this is the Premier's despatch-box, going back to the",CD

2985,"Secretary of State. There are some state secrets for you, and ladies are fond of",CD

2986,"secrets.""",CD

2987,"""Oh! I know nothing about politics,"" she answered, indifferently, ""and we",CD

2988,"have had that box through our office a time or two.""",CD

2989,"""Did you ever notice this mark upon it,"" I asked-""a heart with a dagger",CD

2990,"through it?"" and bending down my face to hers, I added a certain spooney",CD

2991,"remark, which I do not care to repeat. Miss Clifton tossed her little head, and",CD

2992,"pouted her lips; but she took the box out of my hands, and carried it to the",CD

2993,"lamp nearest the further end of the van, after which she put it down upon the",CD

2994,"counter close beside the screen, and I thought no more about it. The midnight",CD

2995,"ride was entertaining in the extreme, for the girl was full of young life and",CD

2996,sauciness and merry humour. I can safely aver that I have never been to an,CD

2997,"evening's so-called entertainment which, to me, was half so enjoyable. It",CD

2998,added also to the zest and keen edge of the enjoyment to see her hasten to hide,CD

2999,herself whenever I told her we were going to stop to take up the mails.,CD

3000,"""We had passed Watford, the last station at which we stopped, before I",CD

3001,became alive to the recollection that our work was terribly behindhand. Miss,CD

3002,"Clifton also became grave, and sat at the end of the counter very quiet and",CD

3003,"subdued, as if her frolic were over, and it was possible she might find",CD

3004,something to repent of in it. I had told her we should stop no more until we,CD

3005,"reached Euston-square station, but to my surprise I felt our speed decreasing,",CD

3006,and our train coming to a standstill. I looked out and called to the guard in the,CD

3007,"van behind, who told me he supposed there was something on the line before",CD

3008,"us, and that we should go on in a minute or two. I turned my head, and gave",CD

3009,this information to my fellow-clerk and Miss Clifton.,CD

3010,"""Do you know where we are?"" she asked, in a frightened tone.",CD

3011,"""At Camden-town,"" I replied. She sprang hastily from her seat, and came",CD

3012,towards me.,CD

3013,"""I am close to my friend's house here,"" she said, ""so it is a lucky thing for",CD

3014,me. It is not five minutes' walk from the station. I will say good-bye to you,CD

3015,"now, Mr. Wilcox, and I thank you a thousand times for your kindness.""",CD

3016,"She seemed flurried, and she held out both her little hands to me in an",CD

3017,"appealing kind of way, as if she were afraid of my detaining her against her",CD

3018,"will. I took them both into mine, pressing them with rather more ardour than",CD

3019,was quite necessary.,CD

3020,"""I do not like you to go alone at this hour,"" I said, ""but there is no help for",CD

3021,"it. It has been a delightful time to me. Will you allow me to call upon you tomorrow morning early, for I leave London at 10.30; or on Wednesday, when I",CD

3022,"shall be in town again?""",CD

3023,"""O,"" she answered, hanging her head, ""I don't know. I'll write and tell",CD

3024,"mamma how kind you have been, and, and-but I must go, Mr. Wilcox.""",CD

3025,"""I don't like your going alone,"" I repeated.",CD

3026,"""O! I know the way perfectly,"" she said, in the same flurried manner,",CD

3027,"""perfectly, thank you. And it is close at hand. Goodbye.""",CD

3028,"She jumped lightly out of the carriage, and the train started on again at the",CD

3029,"same instant. We were busy enough, as you may suppose. In five minutes",CD

3030,"more we should be in Euston-square, and there was nearly fifteen minutes",CD

3031,"work still to be done. Spite of the enjoyment he had afforded me, I mentally",CD

3032,"anathematised Mr. Huntingdon and his departure from ordinary rules, and,",CD

3033,"thrusting Miss Clifton forcibly out of my thoughts, I set to work with a will,",CD

3034,"gathered up the registered letters for London, tied them into a bundle with the",CD

3035,"paper bill, and then turned to the corner of the counter for the despatch-box.",CD

3036,"You have guessed already my cursed misfortune. The Premier's despatchbox was not there. For the first minute or so I was in nowise alarmed, and",CD

3037,"merely looked round, upon the floor, under the bags, into the boxes, into any",CD

3038,"place into which it could have fallen or been deposited. We reached Eustonsquare while I was still searching, and losing more and more of my composure",CD

3039,"every instant. Tom Morville joined me in my quest, and felt every bag which",CD

3040,had been made up and sealed. The box was no small article which could go,CD

3041,"into little compass; it was certainly twelve inches long, and more than that in",CD

3042,girth. But it turned up nowhere. I never felt nearer fainting than at that,CD

3043,moment.,CD

3044,"""Could Miss Clifton have carried it off?"" suggested Tom Morville.",CD

3045,"""No,"" I said, indignantly but thoughtfully, ""she couldn't have carried off",CD

3046,"such a bulky thing as that, without our seeing it. It would not go into one of",CD

3047,"our pockets, Tom, and she wore a tight-fitting jacket that would not conceal",CD

3048,"anything.""",CD

3049,"""No, she can't have it,"" assented Tom; ""then it must be somewhere about.""",CD

3050,"We searched again and again, turning over everything in the van, but without",CD

3051,success. The Premier's despatch-box was gone; and all we could do at first,CD

3052,was to stand and stare at one another. Our trance of blank dismay was of short,CD

3053,"duration, for the van was assailed by the postmen from St. Martin's-le-Grand,",CD

3054,who were waiting for our charge. In a stupor of bewilderment we completed,CD

3055,"our work, and delivered up the mails; then, once more we confronted one",CD

3056,"another with pale faces, frightened out of our seven senses. All the scrapes we",CD

3057,had ever been in (and we had had our usual share of errors and blunders) faded,CD

3058,into utter insignificance compared with this. My eye fell upon Mr.,CD

3059,"Huntingdon's order lying among some scraps of waste paper on the floor, and",CD

3060,"I picked it up, and put it carefully, with its official envelope, into my pocket.",CD

3061,"""We can't stay here,"" said Tom. The porters were looking in inquisitively;",CD

3062,we were seldom so long in quitting oar empty van.,CD

3063,"""No,"" I replied, a sudden gleam of sense darting across the blank",CD

3064,"bewilderment of my brain; ""no, we must go to head-quarters at once, and",CD

3065,"make a clean breast of it. This is no private business, Tom.""",CD

3066,"We made one more ineffectual search, and then we hailed a cab and drove",CD

3067,as hard as we could to the General Post-office. The secretary of the Post-office,CD

3068,"was not there, of course, but we obtained the address of his residence in one of",CD

3069,"the suburbs, four or five miles from the City, and we told no one of our",CD

3070,"misfortune, my idea being that the fewer who were made acquainted with the",CD

3071,loss the better. My judgment was in the right there.,CD

3072,We had to knock up the household of the secretary-a formidable,CD

3073,personage with whom I had never been brought into contact before-and in a,CD

3074,short time we were holding a strictly private and confidential interview with,CD

3075,"him, by the glimmer of a solitary candle, just serving to light up his severe",CD

3076,"face, which changed its expression several times as I narrated the calamity. It",CD

3077,"was too stupendous for rebuke, and I fancied his eyes softened with something",CD

3078,"like commiseration as he gazed upon us. After a short interval of deliberation,",CD

3079,he announced his intention of accompanying us to the residence of the,CD

3080,Secretary of State; and in a few minutes we were driving back again to the,CD

3081,opposite extremity of London. It was not far off the hour for the morning,CD

3082,delivery of letters when we reached our destination; but the atmosphere was,CD

3083,"yellow with fog, and we could see nothing as we passed along in almost utter",CD

3084,"silence, for neither of us ventured to speak, and the secretary only made a brief",CD

3085,"remark now and then. We drove up to some dwelling enveloped in fog, and we",CD

3086,"were left in the cab for nearly half an hour, while our secretary went in. At the",CD

3087,end of that time we were summoned to an apartment where there was seated at,CD

3088,"a large desk a small spare man, with a great head, and eyes deeply sunk under",CD

3089,"the brows. There was no form of introduction, of course, and we could only",CD

3090,"guess who he might be; but we were requested to repeat our statement, and a",CD

3091,few shrewd questions were put to us by the stranger. We were eager to put him,CD

3092,"in possession of everything we knew, but that was little beyond the fact that",CD

3093,the despatch-box was lost.,CD

3094,"""That young person must have taken it,"" he said.",CD

3095,"""She could not, sir,"" I answered, positively, but deferentially. ""She wore",CD

3096,"the tightest-fitting pelisse I ever saw, and she gave me both her hands when",CD

3097,she said good-bye. She could not possibly have it concealed about her. It,CD

3098,"would not go into my pocket.""",CD

3099,"""How did she come to travel up with you in the van, sir?"" he asked",CD

3100,severely.,CD

3101,I gave him for answer the order signed by Mr. Huntingdon. He and our,CD

3102,secretary scanned it closely.,CD

3103,"""It is Huntingdon's signature without doubt,"" said the latter; ""I could swear",CD

3104,"to it anywhere. This is an extraordinary circumstance!""",CD

3105,It was an extraordinary circumstance. The two retired into an adjoining,CD

3106,"room, where they stayed for another half-hour, and when they returned to us",CD

3107,their faces still bore an aspect of grave perplexity.,CD

3108,"""Mr. Wilcox and Mr. Morville,"" said our secretary, ""it is expedient that this",CD

3109,affair should be kept inviolably secret. You must even be careful not to hint,CD

3110,"that you hold any secret. You did well not to announce your loss at the Postoffice, and I shall cause it to be understood that you had instructions to take",CD

3111,the despatch-box direct to its destination. Your business now is to find the,CD

3112,"young woman, and return with her not later than six o'clock this afternoon to",CD

3113,my office at the General Post-office. What other steps we think it requisite to,CD

3114,"take, you need know nothing about; the less you know, the better for",CD

3115,"yourselves.""",CD

3116,Another gleam of commiseration in his official eye made our hearts sink,CD

3117,"within us. We departed promptly, and, with that instinct of wisdom which at",CD

3118,"times dictates infallibly what course we should pursue, we decided our line of",CD

3119,"action. Tom Morville was to go down to Camden-town, and inquire at every",CD

3120,"house for Miss Clifton, while I-there would be just time for it-was to run",CD

3121,down to Eaton by train and obtain her exact address from her parents. We,CD

3122,"agreed to meet at the General Post-office at half-past five, if I could possibly",CD

3123,reach it by that time; but in any case Tom was to report himself to the,CD

3124,secretary and account for my absence.,CD

3125,"When I arrived at the station at Eaton, I found that I had only forty-five",CD

3126,"minutes before the up train went by. The town was nearly a mile away, but I",CD

3127,made all the haste I could to reach it. I was not surprised to find the post-office,CD

3128,"in connexion with a bookseller's shop, and I saw a pleasant elderly lady seated",CD

3129,"behind the counter, while a tall dark-haired girl was sitting at some work a",CD

3130,little out of sight. I introduced myself at once.,CD

3131,"""I am Frank Wilcox, of the railway post-office, and I have just run down to",CD

3132,"Eaton to obtain some information from you.""",CD

3133,"""Certainly. We know you well by name,"" was the reply, given in a cordial",CD

3134,"manner, which was particularly pleasant to me.",CD

3135,"""Will you be so good as give me the address of Miss Anne Clifton in",CD

3136,"Camden-town?"" I said.",CD

3137,"""Miss Anne Clifton?"" ejaculated the lady.",CD

3138,"""Yes. Your daughter, I presume. Who went up to London last night.""",CD

3139,"""I have no daughter Anne,"" she said; ""I am Anne Clifton, and my",CD

3140,"daughters are named Mary and Susan. This is my daughter Mary.""",CD

3141,"The tall dark-haired girl had left her seat, and now stood beside her",CD

3142,mother. Certainly she was very unlike the small golden-haired coquette who,CD

3143,had travelled up to London with me as Anne Clifton.,CD

3144,"""Madam,"" I said, scarcely able to speak, ""is your other daughter a slender",CD

3145,"little creature, exactly the reverse of this young lady?""",CD

3146,"""No,"" she answered, laughing; ""Susan is both taller and darker than Mary.",CD

3147,"Call Susan, my dear.""",CD

3148,"In a few seconds Miss Susan made her appearance, and I had the three",CD

3149,"before me-A. Clifton, S. Clifton, and M. Clifton. There was no other girl in",CD

3150,the family; and when I described the young lady who had travelled under their,CD

3151,"name, they could not think of any one in the town-it was a small one-who",CD

3152,"answered my description, or who had gone on a visit to London. I had no time",CD

3153,"to spare, and I hurried back to the station, just catching the train as it left the",CD

3154,"platform. At the appointed hour I met Morville at the General Post-office, and",CD

3155,"threading the long passages of the secretary's offices, we at length found",CD

3156,"ourselves anxiously waiting in an ante-room, until we were called into his",CD

3157,"presence. Morville had discovered nothing, except that the porters and",CD

3158,"policemen at Camden-town station had seen a young lady pass out last night,",CD

3159,"attended by a swarthy man who looked like a foreigner, and carried a small",CD

3160,black portmanteau.,CD

3161,"I scarcely know how long we waited; it might have been years, for I was",CD

3162,"conscious of an ever-increasing difficulty in commanding my thoughts, or",CD

3163,fixing them upon the subject which had engrossed them all day. I had not,CD

3164,"tasted food for twenty-four hours, nor closed my eyes for thirty-six, while,",CD

3165,"during the whole of the time, my nervous system had been on full strain.",CD

3166,"Presently, the summons came, and I was ushered, first, into the inner",CD

3167,"apartment. There sat five gentlemen round a table, which was strewed with a",CD

3168,"number of documents. There were the Secretary of State, whom we had seen",CD

3169,"in the morning, our secretary, and Mr. Huntingdon; the fourth was a finelooking man, whom I afterwards knew to be the Premier; the fifth I recognised",CD

3170,"as our great chief, the Postmaster-General. It was an august assemblage to me,",CD

3171,"and I bowed low; but my head was dizzy, and my throat parched.",CD

3172,"""Mr. Wilcox,"" said our secretary, ""you will tell these gentlemen again, the",CD

3173,"circumstances of the loss you reported to me this morning.""",CD

3174,"I laid my hand upon the back of a chair to steady myself, and went through",CD

3175,"the narration for the third time, passing over sundry remarks made by myself",CD

3176,"to the young lady. That done, I added the account of my expedition to Eaton,",CD

3177,and the certainty at which I had arrived that my fellow-traveller was not the,CD

3178,"person she represented herself to be. After which, I inquired with",CD

3179,indescribable anxiety if Mr. Huntingdon's order were a forgery?,CD

3180,"""I cannot tell, Mr. Wilcox,"" said that gentleman, taking the order into his",CD

3181,"hands, and regarding it with an air of extreme perplexity. ""I could have sworn",CD

3182,"it was mine, had it been attached to any other document. I think Forbes's",CD

3183,"handwriting is not so well imitated. But it is the very ink I use, and mine is a",CD

3184,"peculiar signature.""",CD

3185,"It was a very peculiar and old-fashioned signature, with a flourish",CD

3186,"underneath it not unlike a whip-handle, with the lash caught round it in the",CD

3187,"middle; but that did not make it the more difficult to forge, as I humbly",CD

3188,"suggested. Mr. Huntingdon wrote his name upon a paper, and two or three of",CD

3189,"the gentlemen tried to imitate the flourish, but vainly. They gave it up with a",CD

3190,smile upon their grave faces.,CD

3191,"""You have been careful not to let a hint of this matter drop from you, Mr.",CD

3192,"Wilcox?"" said the Postmaster-General.",CD

3193,"""Not a syllable, my lord,"" I answered.",CD

3194,"""It is imperatively necessary that the secret should be kept. You would be",CD

3195,"removed from the temptation of telling it, if you had an appointment in some",CD

3196,"office abroad. The packet-agency at Alexandria is vacant, and I will have you",CD

3197,"appointed to it at once.""",CD

3198,"It would be a good advance from my present situation, and would",CD

3199,doubtless prove a stepping-stone to other and better appointments; but I had a,CD

3200,"mother living at Fazeley, bedridden and paralytic, who had no pleasure in",CD

3201,existence except having me to dwell under the same roof with her. My head,CD

3202,"was growing more and more dizzy, and a strange vagueness was creeping over",CD

3203,me.,CD

3204,"""Gentlemen,"" I muttered, ""I have a bedridden mother whom I cannot",CD

3205,"leave. I was not to blame, gentlemen."" I fancied there was a stir and movement",CD

3206,"at the table, but my eyes were dim, and in another second I had lost",CD

3207,consciousness.,CD

3208,"When I came to myself, in two or three minutes, I found that Mr.",CD

3209,"Huntingdon was kneeling on the floor beside me, supporting my head, while",CD

3210,"our secretary held a glass of wine to my lips. I rallied as quickly as possible,",CD

3211,and staggered to my feet; but the two gentlemen placed me in the chair against,CD

3212,"which I had been leaning, and insisted upon my finishing the wine before I",CD

3213,tried to speak.,CD

3214,"""I have not tasted food all day,"" I said, faintly.",CD

3215,"""Then, my good fellow, you shall go home immediately,"" said the",CD

3216,"Postmaster-General; ""but be on your guard! Not a word of this must escape",CD

3217,"you. Are you a married man?""",CD

3218,"""No, my lord,"" I answered.",CD

3219,"""So much the better,"" he added, smiling. ""You can keep a secret from your",CD

3220,"mother, I dare say. We rely upon your honour.""",CD

3221,"The secretary then rang a bell, and I was committed to the charge of the",CD

3222,messenger who answered it; and in a few minutes I was being conveyed in a,CD

3223,"cab to my London lodgings. A week afterwards, Tom Morville was sent out to",CD

3224,"a post-office in Canada, where he settled down, married, and is still living,",CD

3225,"perfectly satisfied with his position, as he occasionally informs me by letter.",CD

3226,"For myself, I remained as I desired, in my old post as travelling-clerk until the",CD

3227,"death of my mother, which occurred some ten or twelve months afterwards. I",CD

3228,"was then promoted to an appointment as a clerk in charge, upon the first",CD

3229,vacancy.,CD

3230,The business of the clerks in charge is to take possession of any post-office,CD

3231,"in the kingdom, upon the death or resignation of the postmaster, or when",CD

3232,circumstances of suspicion cause his suspension from office. My new duties,CD

3233,carried me three or four times into Mr. Huntingdon's district. Though that,CD

3234,gentleman and I never exchanged a word with regard to the mysterious loss in,CD

3235,"which we had both had an innocent share, he distinguished me with peculiar",CD

3236,"favour, and more than once invited me to visit him at his own house. He lived",CD

3237,"alone, having but one daughter, who had married, somewhat against his will,",CD

3238,one of his clerks: the Mr. Forbes whose handwriting had been so successfully,CD

3239,imitated in the official order presented to me by the self-styled Miss Anne,CD

3240,"Clifton. (By the way, I may here mention, though it has nothing to do with my",CD

3241,"story, that my acquaintance with the Cliftons had ripened into an intimacy,",CD

3242,which resulted in my engagement and marriage to Mary.),CD

3243,It would be beside my purpose to specify the precise number of years,CD

3244,which elapsed before I was once again summoned to the secretary's private,CD

3245,"apartment, where I found him closeted with Mr. Huntingdon. Mr. Huntingdon",CD

3246,shook hands with unofficial cordiality; and then the secretary proceeded to,CD

3247,state the business on hand.,CD

3248,"""Mr. Wilcox, you remember our offer to place you in office in",CD

3249,"Alexandria?"" he said.",CD

3250,"""Certainly, sir,"" I answered.",CD

3251,"""It has been a troublesome office,"" he continued, almost pettishly. ""We",CD

3252,"sent out Mr. Forbes only six months ago, on account of his health, which",CD

3253,"required a warmer climate, and now his medical man reports that his life is not",CD

3254,"worth three weeks' purchase.""",CD

3255,Upon Mr. Huntingdon's face there rested an expression of profound,CD

3256,anxiety; and as the secretary paused he addressed himself to me.,CD

3257,"""Mr. Wilcox,"" he said, ""I have been soliciting, as a personal favour, that",CD

3258,"you should be sent out to take charge of the packet-agency, in order that my",CD

3259,"daughter may have some one at hand to befriend her, and manage her business",CD

3260,"affairs for her. You are not personally acquainted with her, but I know I can",CD

3261,"trust her with you.""",CD

3262,"""You may, Mr. Huntingdon,"" I said, warmly. ""I will do anything I can to",CD

3263,"aid Mrs. Forbes. When do you wish me to start?""",CD

3264,"""How soon can you be ready?"" was the rejoinder.",CD

3265,"""To-morrow morning.""",CD

3266,"I was not married then, and I anticipated no delay in setting off. Nor was",CD

3267,"there any. I travelled with the overland mail through France to Marseilles,",CD

3268,"embarked in a vessel for Alexandria, and in a few days from the time I first",CD

3269,heard of my destination set foot in the office there. All the postal arrangements,CD

3270,"had fallen into considerable irregularity and confusion; for, as I was informed",CD

3271,"immediately on my arrival, Mr. Forbes had been in a dying condition for the",CD

3272,"last week, and of course the absence of a master had borne the usual results. I",CD

3273,"took formal possession of the office, and then, conducted by one of the clerks,",CD

3274,I proceeded to the dwelling of the unfortunate postmaster and his no less,CD

3275,unfortunate wife. It would be out of place in this narrative to indulge in any,CD

3276,traveller's tales about the strange place where I was so unexpectedly located.,CD

3277,"Suffice it to say, that the darkened sultry room into which I was shown, on",CD

3278,"inquiring for Mrs. Forbes, was bare of furniture, and destitute of all those little",CD

3279,tokens of refinement and taste which make our English parlours so pleasant to,CD

3280,"the eye. There was, however, a piano in one of the dark corners of the room,",CD

3281,"open, and with a sheet of music on it. While I waited for Mrs. Forbes's",CD

3282,"appearance, I strolled idly up to the piano to see what music it might be. The",CD

3283,next moment my eye fell upon an antique red morocco workbox standing on,CD

3284,"the top of the piano-a workbox evidently, for the lid was not closely shut,",CD

3285,and a few threads of silk and cotton were hanging out of it. In a kind of dream,CD

3286,-for it was difficult to believe that the occurrence was a fact-I carried the,CD

3287,"box to the darkened window, and there, plain in my sight, was the device",CD

3288,scratched upon the leather: the revolutionary symbol of a heart with a dagger,CD

3289,through it. I had found the Premier's despatch-box in the parlour of the packetagent of Alexandria!,CD

3290,"I stood for some minutes with that dream-like feeling upon me, gazing at",CD

3291,the box in the dim obscure light. It could not be real! My fancy must be,CD

3292,"playing a trick upon me! But the sound of a light step-for, light as it was, I",CD

3293,"heard it distinctly as it approached the room-broke my trance, and I hastened",CD

3294,"to replace the box on the piano, and to stoop down as if examining the music",CD

3295,"before the door opened. I had not sent in my name to Mrs. Forbes, for I did not",CD

3296,"suppose that she was acquainted with it, nor could she see me distinctly, as I",CD

3297,"stood in the gloom. But I could see her. She had the slight slender figure, the",CD

3298,"childlike face, and the fair hair of Miss Anne Clifton. She came quickly across",CD

3299,"the room, holding out both her hands in a childish appealing manner.",CD

3300,"""O!"" she wailed, in a tone that went straight to my heart, ""he is dead! He",CD

3301,"has just died!""",CD

3302,It was no time then to speak about the red morocco workbox. This little,CD

3303,"childish creature, who did not look a day older than when I had last seen her in",CD

3304,"my travelling post-office, was a widow in a strange land, far away from any",CD

3305,friend save myself. I had brought her a letter from her father. The first duties,CD

3306,"that devolved upon me were those of her husband's interment, which had to",CD

3307,"take place immediately. Three or four weeks elapsed before I could, with any",CD

3308,"humanity, enter upon the investigation of her mysterious complicity in the",CD

3309,daring theft practised on the government and the post-office.,CD

3310,I did not see the despatch-box again. In the midst of her new and vehement,CD

3311,"grief, Mrs. Forbes had the precaution to remove it before I was ushered again",CD

3312,into the room where I had discovered it. I was at some trouble to hit upon any,CD

3313,plan by which to gain a second sight of it; but I was resolved that Mrs. Forbes,CD

3314,should not leave Alexandria without giving me a full explanation. We were,CD

3315,"waiting for remittances and instructions from England, and in the meantime",CD

3316,"the violence of her grief abated, and she recovered a good share of her old",CD

3317,"buoyancy and loveliness, which had so delighted me on my first acquaintance",CD

3318,"with her. As her demands upon my sympathy weakened, my curiosity grew",CD

3319,"stronger, and at last mastered me. I carried with me a netted purse which",CD

3320,"required mending, and I asked her to catch up the broken meshes while I",CD

3321,waited for it.,CD

3322,"""I will tell your maid to bring your workbox,"" I said, going to the door and",CD

3323,"calling the servant. ""Your mistress has a red morocco workbox,"" I said to her,",CD

3324,as she answered my summons.,CD

3325,"""Yes, sir,"" she replied.",CD

3326,"""Where is it?""",CD

3327,"""In her bedroom,"" she said.",CD

3328,"""Mrs. Forbes wishes it brought here."" I turned back into the room. Mrs.",CD

3329,"Forbes had gone deadly pale, but her eyes looked sullen, and her teeth were",CD

3330,clenched under her lips with an expression of stubbornness. The maid brought,CD

3331,"the workbox. I walked, with it in my hands, up to the sofa where she was",CD

3332,seated.,CD

3333,"""You remember this mark?"" I asked; ""I think neither of us can ever forget",CD

3334,"it.""",CD

3335,"She did not answer by word, but there was a very intelligent gleam in her",CD

3336,blue eyes.,CD

3337,"""Now,"" I continued, softly, ""I promised your father to befriend you, and I",CD

3338,am not a man to forget a promise. But you must tell me the whole simple,CD

3339,"truth.""",CD

3340,"I was compelled to reason with her, and to urge her for some time. I",CD

3341,confess I went so far as to remind her that there was an English consul at,CD

3342,"Alexandria, to whom I could resort. At last she opened her stubborn lips, and",CD

3343,"the whole story came out, mingled with sobs and showers of tears.",CD

3344,"She had been in love with Alfred, she said, and they were too poor to",CD

3345,"marry, and papa would not hear of such a thing. She was always in want of",CD

3346,"money, she was kept so short; and they promised to give her such a great sum",CD

3347,-a vast sum-five hundred pounds.,CD

3348,"""But who bribed you?"" I inquired.",CD

3349,"A foreign gentleman whom she had met in London, called Monsieur",CD

3350,"Bonnard. It was a French name, but she was not sure that he was a Frenchman.",CD

3351,"He talked to her about her father being a surveyor in the post-office, and asked",CD

3352,"her a great number of questions. A few weeks after, she met him in their own",CD

3353,"town by accident, she and Mr. Forbes; and Alfred had a long private talk with",CD

3354,"him, and they came to her, and told her she could help them very much. They",CD

3355,asked her if she could be brave enough to carry off a little red box out of the,CD

3356,"travelling post-office, containing nothing but papers. After a while she",CD

3357,"consented. When she had confessed so much under compulsion, Mrs. Forbes",CD

3358,"seemed to take a pleasure in the narrative, and went on fluently.",CD

3359,"""We required papa's signature to the order, and we did not know how to",CD

3360,"get it. Luckily he had a fit of the gout, and was very peevish; and I had to read",CD

3361,"over a lot of official papers to him, and then he signed them. One of the papers",CD

3362,"I read twice, and slipped the order into its place after the second reading. I",CD

3363,"thought I should have died with fright; but just then he was in great pain, and",CD

3364,glad to get his work over. I made an excuse that I was going to visit my aunt at,CD

3365,"Beckby, but instead of going there direct, we contrived to be at the station at",CD

3366,Eaton a minute or two before the mail train came up. I kept outside the station,CD

3367,"door till we heard the whistle, and just then the postman came running down",CD

3368,"the road, and I followed him straight through the booking-office, and asked",CD

3369,"him to give you the order, which I put into his hand. He scarcely saw me. I just",CD

3370,caught a glimpse of Monsieur Bonnard's face through the window of the,CD

3371,"compartment next the van, when Alfred had gone. They had promised me that",CD

3372,"the train should stop at Camden-town, if I could only keep your attention",CD

3373,"engaged until then. You know how I succeeded.""",CD

3374,"""But how did you dispose of the box?"" I asked. ""You could not have",CD

3375,"concealed it about you; that I am sure of.""",CD

3376,"""Ah!"" she said, ""nothing was easier. Monsieur Bonnard had described the",CD

3377,"van to me, and you remember I put the box down at the end of the counter,",CD

3378,close to the corner where I hid myself at every station. There was a door with,CD

3379,"a window in it, and I asked if I might have the window open, as the van was",CD

3380,too warm for me. I believe Monsieur Bonnard could have taken it from me by,CD

3381,"only leaning through his window, but he preferred stepping out, and taking it",CD

3382,"from my hand, just as the train was leaving Watford-on the far side of the",CD

3383,"carriages, you understand. It was the last station, and the train came to a stand",CD

3384,"at Camden-town. After all, the box was not out of your sight more than twenty",CD

3385,minutes before you missed it. Monsieur Bonnard and I hurried out of the,CD

3386,"station, and Alfred followed us. The box was forced open-the lock has never",CD

3387,"been mended, for it was a peculiar one-and Monsieur Bonnard took",CD

3388,"possession of the papers. He left the box with me, after putting inside it a roll",CD

3389,"of notes. Alfred and I were married next morning, and I went back to my",CD

3390,aunt's; but we did not tell papa of our marriage for three or four months. That,CD

3391,"is the story of my red morocco workbox.""",CD

3392,She smiled with the provoking mirthfulness of a mischievous child. There,CD

3393,"was one point still, on which my curiosity was unsatisfied.",CD

3394,"""Did you know what the despatches were about?"" I asked.",CD

3395,"""O no!"" she answered; ""I never understood politics in the least. I knew",CD

3396,nothing about them. Monsieur did not say a word; he did not even look at the,CD

3397,"papers while we were by. I would never, never, have taken a registered letter,",CD

3398,"or anything with money in it, you know. But all those papers could be written",CD

3399,"again quite easily. You must not think me a thief, Mr. Wilcox; there was",CD

3400,"nothing worth money among the papers.""",CD

3401,"""They were worth five hundred pounds to you,"" I said. ""Did you ever see",CD

3402,"Bonnard again?""",CD

3403,"""Never again,"" she replied. ""He said he was going to return to his native",CD

3404,"country. I don't think Bonnard was his real name.""",CD

3405,"Most likely not, I thought; but I said no more to Mrs. Forbes. Once again I",CD

3406,was involved in a great perplexity about this affair. It was clearly my duty to,CD

3407,"report the discovery at head-quarters, but I shrank from doing so. One of the",CD

3408,chief culprits was already gone to another judgment than that of man; several,CD

3409,years had obliterated all traces of Monsieur Bonnard; and the only victim of,CD

3410,justice would be this poor little dupe of the two greater criminals. At last I,CD

3411,came to the conclusion to send the whole of the particulars to Mr. Huntingdon,CD

3412,"himself; and I wrote them to him, without remark or comment.",CD

3413,The answer that came to Mrs. Forbes and me in Alexandria was the,CD

3414,"announcement of Mr. Huntingdon's sudden death of some disease of the heart,",CD

3415,on the day which I calculated would put him in possession of my,CD

3416,communication. Mrs. Forbes was again overwhelmed with apparently,CD

3417,heartrending sorrow and remorse. The income left to her was something less,CD

3418,"than one hundred pounds a year. The secretary of the post-office, who had",CD

3419,"been a personal friend of the deceased gentleman, was his sole executor; and I",CD

3420,"received a letter from him, containing one for Mrs. Forbes, which",CD

3421,"recommended her, in terms not to be misunderstood, to fix upon some",CD

3422,"residence abroad, and not to return to England. She fancied she would like the",CD

3423,seclusion and quiet of a convent; and I made arrangements for her to enter one,CD

3424,"in Malta, where she would still be under British protection. I left Alexandria",CD

3425,myself on the arrival of another packet-agent; and on my return to London I,CD

3426,had a private interview with the secretary. I found that there was no need to,CD

3427,"inform him of the circumstances I have related to you, as he had taken",CD

3428,possession of all Mr. Huntingdon's papers. In consideration of his ancient,CD

3429,"friendship, and of the escape of those who most merited punishment, he had",CD

3430,come to the conclusion that it was quite as well to let bygones be bygones.,CD

3431,At the conclusion of the interview I delivered a message which Mrs.,CD

3432,Forbes had emphatically entrusted to me.,CD

3433,"""Mrs. Forbes wished me to impress upon your mind,"" I said, ""that neither",CD

3434,she nor Mr. Forbes would have been guilty of this misdemeanour if they had,CD

3435,"not been very much in love with one another, and very much in want of",CD

3436,"money.""",CD

3437,"""Ah!"" replied the secretary, with a smile, ""if Cleopatra's nose had been",CD

3438,"shorter, the fate of the world would have been different!""",CD

3439,No. 5 BRANCH LINE,CD

3440,THE ENGINEER,CD

3441,"His name, sir, was Matthew Price; mine is Benjamin Hardy. We were born",CD

3442,within a few days of each other; bred up in the same village; taught at the,CD

3443,same school. I cannot remember the time when we were not close friends.,CD

3444,"Even as boys, we never knew what it was to quarrel. We had not a thought, we",CD

3445,"had not a possession, that was not in common. We would have stood by each",CD

3446,"other, fearlessly, to the death. It was such a friendship as one reads about",CD

3447,sometimes in books: fast and firm as the great Tors upon our native,CD

3448,"moorlands, true as the sun in the heavens.",CD

3449,The name of our village was Chadleigh. Lifted high above the pasture flats,CD

3450,which stretched away at our feet like a measureless green lake and melted into,CD

3451,"mist on the furthest horizon, it nestled, a tiny stone-built hamlet, in a sheltered",CD

3452,"hollow about midway between the plain and the plateau. Above us, rising",CD

3453,"ridge beyond ridge, slope beyond slope, spread the mountainous moorcountry, bare and bleak for the most part, with here and there a patch of",CD

3454,"cultivated field or hardy plantation, and crowned highest of all with masses of",CD

3455,"huge grey crag, abrupt, isolated, hoary, and older than the deluge. These were",CD

3456,"the Tors-Druids' Tor, King's Tor, Castle Tor, and the like; sacred places, as I",CD

3457,"have heard, in the ancient time, where crownings, burnings, human sacrifices,",CD

3458,"and all kinds of bloody heathen rites were performed. Bones, too, had been",CD

3459,"found there, and arrow-heads, and ornaments of gold and glass. I had a vague",CD

3460,"awe of the Tors in those boyish days, and would not have gone near them after",CD

3461,dark for the heaviest bribe.,CD

3462,I have said that we were born in the same village. He was the son of a,CD

3463,"small farmer, named William Price, and the eldest of a family of seven; I was",CD

3464,"the only child of Ephraim Hardy, the Chadleigh blacksmith-a well-known",CD

3465,"man in those parts, whose memory is not forgotten to this day. Just so far as a",CD

3466,"farmer is supposed to be a bigger man than a blacksmith, Mat's father might",CD

3467,"be said to have a better standing than mine; but William Price, with his small",CD

3468,"holding and his seven boys, was, in fact, as poor as many a day-labourer;",CD

3469,"whilst the blacksmith, well-to-do, bustling, popular, and open-handed, was a",CD

3470,"person of some importance in the place. All this, however, had nothing to do",CD

3471,with Mat and myself. It never occurred to either of us that his jacket was out at,CD

3472,"elbows, or that our mutual funds came altogether from my pocket. It was",CD

3473,"enough for us that we sat on the same school-bench, conned our tasks from the",CD

3474,"same primer, fought each other's battles, screened each other's faults, fished,",CD

3475,"nutted, played truant, robbed orchards and birds' nests together, and spent",CD

3476,"every half-hour, authorised or stolen, in each other's society. It was a happy",CD

3477,"time; but it could not go on for ever. My father, being prosperous, resolved to",CD

3478,"put me forward in the world. I must know more, and do better, than himself.",CD

3479,"The forge was not good enough, the little world of Chadleigh not wide",CD

3480,"enough, for me. Thus it happened that I was still swinging the satchel when",CD

3481,"Mat was whistling at the plough, and that at last, when my future course was",CD

3482,"shaped out, we were separated, as it then seemed to us, for life. For,",CD

3483,"blacksmith's son as I was, furnace and forge, in some form or other, pleased",CD

3484,"me best, and I chose to be a working engineer. So my father by-and-by",CD

3485,"apprenticed me to a Birmingham iron-master; and, having bidden farewell to",CD

3486,"Mat, and Chadleigh, and the grey old Tors in the shadow of which I had spent",CD

3487,"all the days of my life, I turned my face northward, and went over into ""the",CD

3488,"Black Country.""",CD

3489,I am not going to dwell on this part of my story. How I worked out the,CD

3490,"term of my apprenticeship; how, when I had served my full time and become a",CD

3491,"skilled workman, I took Mat from the plough and brought him over to the",CD

3492,"Black Country, sharing with him lodging, wages, experience-all, in short,",CD

3493,"that I had to give; how he, naturally quick to learn and brimful of quiet energy,",CD

3494,"worked his way up a step at a time, and came by-and-by to be a ""first hand"" in",CD

3495,"his own department; how, during all these years of change, and trial, and",CD

3496,"effort, the old boyish affection never wavered or weakened, but went on,",CD

3497,growing with our growth and strengthening with our strength-are facts which,CD

3498,I need do no more than outline in this place.,CD

3499,About this time-it will be remembered that I speak of the days when Mat,CD

3500,and I were on the bright side of thirty-it happened that our firm contracted to,CD

3501,"supply six first-class locomotives to run on the new line, then in process of",CD

3502,"construction, between Turin and Genoa. It was the first Italian order we had",CD

3503,"taken. We had had dealings with France, Holland, Belgium, Germany; but",CD

3504,"never with Italy. The connexion, therefore, was new and valuable-all the",CD

3505,more valuable because our Transalpine neighbours had but lately begun to lay,CD

3506,"down the iron roads, and would be safe to need more of our good English",CD

3507,work as they went on. So the Birmingham firm set themselves to the contract,CD

3508,"with a will, lengthened our working hours, increased our wages, took on fresh",CD

3509,"hands, and determined, if energy and promptitude could do it, to place",CD

3510,"themselves at the head of the Italian labour-market, and stay there. They",CD

3511,deserved and achieved success. The six locomotives were not only turned out,CD

3512,"to time, but were shipped, despatched, and delivered with a promptitude that",CD

3513,"fairly amazed our Piedmontese consignee. I was not a little proud, you may be",CD

3514,"sure, when I found myself appointed to superintend the transport of the",CD

3515,"engines. Being allowed a couple of assistants, I contrived that Mat should be",CD

3516,one of them; and thus we enjoyed together the first great holiday of our lives.,CD

3517,It was a wonderful change for two Birmingham operatives fresh from the,CD

3518,"Black Country. The fairy city, with its crescent background of Alps; the port",CD

3519,crowded with strange shipping; the marvellous blue sky and bluer sea; the,CD

3520,"painted houses on the quays; the quaint cathedral, faced with black and white",CD

3521,"marble; the street of jewellers, like an Arabian Nights' bazaar; the street of",CD

3522,"palaces, with its Moorish court-yards, its fountains and orange-trees; the",CD

3523,women veiled like brides; the galley-slaves chained two and two; the,CD

3524,processions of priests and friars; the everlasting clangour of bells; the babble,CD

3525,of a strange tongue; the singular lightness and brightness of the climate-,CD

3526,"made, altogether, such a combination of wonders that we wandered about, the",CD

3527,"first day, in a kind of bewildered dream, like children at a fair. Before that",CD

3528,"week was ended, being tempted by the beauty of the place and the liberality of",CD

3529,"the pay, we had agreed to take service with the Turin and Genoa Railway",CD

3530,"Company, and to turn our backs upon Birmingham for ever.",CD

3531,"Then began a new life-a life so active and healthy, so steeped in fresh air",CD

3532,"and sunshine, that we sometimes marvelled how we could have endured the",CD

3533,gloom of the Black Country. We were constantly up and down the line: now at,CD

3534,"Genoa, now at Turin, taking trial trips with the locomotives, and placing our",CD

3535,old experiences at the service of our new employers.,CD

3536,"In the meanwhile we made Genoa our headquarters, and hired a couple of",CD

3537,rooms over a small shop in a by-street sloping down to the quays. Such a busy,CD

3538,"little street-so steep and winding that no vehicles could pass through it, and",CD

3539,so narrow that the sky looked like a mere strip of deep-blue ribbon overhead!,CD

3540,"Every house in it, however, was a shop, where the goods encroached on the",CD

3541,"footway, or were piled about the door, or hung like tapestry from the",CD

3542,"balconies; and all day long, from dawn to dusk, an incessant stream of passersby poured up and down between the port and the upper quarter of the city.",CD

3543,"Our landlady was the widow of a silver-worker, and lived by the sale of",CD

3544,"filigree ornaments, cheap jewellery, combs, fans, and toys in ivory and jet. She",CD

3545,"had an only daughter named Gianetta, who served in the shop, and was simply",CD

3546,the most beautiful woman I ever beheld. Looking back across this weary,CD

3547,"chasm of years, and bringing her image before me (as I can and do) with all",CD

3548,"the vividness of life, I am unable, even now, to detect a flaw in her beauty. I do",CD

3549,not attempt to describe her. I do not believe there is a poet living who could,CD

3550,find the words to do it; but I once saw a picture that was somewhat like her,CD

3551,"(not half so lovely, but still like her), and, for aught I know, that picture is still",CD

3552,hanging where I last looked at it-upon the walls of the Louvre. It represented,CD

3553,"a woman with brown eyes and golden hair, looking over her shoulder into a",CD

3554,"circular mirror held by a bearded man in the background. In this man, as I then",CD

3555,"understood, the artist had painted his own portrait; in her, the portrait of the",CD

3556,"woman he loved. No picture that I ever saw was half so beautiful, and yet it",CD

3557,was not worthy to be named in the same breath with Gianetta Coneglia.,CD

3558,You may be certain the widow's shop did not want for customers. All,CD

3559,Genoa knew how fair a face was to be seen behind that dingy little counter;,CD

3560,"and Gianetta, flirt as she was, had more lovers than she cared to remember,",CD

3561,"even by name. Gentle and simple, rich and poor, from the red-capped sailor",CD

3562,"buying his earrings or his amulet, to the nobleman carelessly purchasing half",CD

3563,"the filigrees in the window, she treated them all alike-encouraged them,",CD

3564,"laughed at them, led them on and turned them off at her pleasure. She had no",CD

3565,"more heart than a marble statue; as Mat and I discovered by-and-by, to our",CD

3566,bitter cost.,CD

3567,"I cannot tell to this day how it came about, or what first led me to suspect",CD

3568,how things were going with us both; but long before the waning of that,CD

3569,autumn a coldness had sprung up between my friend and myself. It was,CD

3570,nothing that could have been put into words. It was nothing that either of us,CD

3571,"could have explained or justified, to save his life. We lodged together, ate",CD

3572,"together, worked together, exactly as before; we even took our long evening's",CD

3573,"walk together, when the day's labour was ended; and except, perhaps, that we",CD

3574,"were more silent than of old, no mere looker-on could have detected a shadow",CD

3575,"of change. Yet there it was, silent and subtle, widening the gulf between us",CD

3576,every day.,CD

3577,It was not his fault. He was too true and gentle-hearted to have willingly,CD

3578,brought about such a state of things between us. Neither do I believe-fiery as,CD

3579,my nature is-that it was mine. It was all hers-hers from first to last-the,CD

3580,"sin, and the shame, and the sorrow.",CD

3581,"If she had shown a fair and open preference for either of us, no real harm",CD

3582,"could have come of it. I would have put any constraint upon myself, and,",CD

3583,"Heaven knows! have borne any suffering, to see Mat really happy. I know that",CD

3584,"he would have done the same, and more if he could, for me. But Gianetta",CD

3585,cared not one sou for either. She never meant to choose between us. It gratified,CD

3586,her vanity to divide us; it amused her to play with us. It would pass my power,CD

3587,"to tell how, by a thousand imperceptible shades of coquetry-by the lingering",CD

3588,"of a glance, the substitution of a word, the flitting of a smile-she contrived to",CD

3589,"turn our heads, and torture our hearts, and lead us on to love her. She deceived",CD

3590,us both. She buoyed us both up with hope; she maddened us with jealousy; she,CD

3591,"crushed us with despair. For my part, when I seemed to wake to a sudden",CD

3592,sense of the ruin that was about our path and I saw how the truest friendship,CD

3593,"that ever bound two lives together was drifting on to wreck and ruin, I asked",CD

3594,myself whether any woman in the world was worth what Mat had been to me,CD

3595,and I to him. But this was not often. I was readier to shut my eyes upon the,CD

3596,"truth than to face it; and so lived on, wilfully, in a dream.",CD

3597,"Thus the autumn passed away, and winter came-the strange, treacherous,",CD

3598,"Genoese winter, green with olive and ilex, brilliant with sunshine, and bitter",CD

3599,"with storm. Still, rivals at heart and friends on the surface, Mat and I lingered",CD

3600,on in our lodging in the Vicolo Balba. Still Gianetta held us with her fatal,CD

3601,wiles and her still more fatal beauty. At length there came a day when I felt I,CD

3602,"could bear the horrible misery and suspense of it no longer. The sun, I vowed,",CD

3603,should not go down before I knew my sentence. She must choose between us.,CD

3604,She must either take me or let me go. I was reckless. I was desperate. I was,CD

3605,"determined to know the worst, or the best. If the worst, I would at once turn",CD

3606,"my back upon Genoa, upon her, upon all the pursuits and purposes of my past",CD

3607,"life, and begin the world anew. This I told her, passionately and sternly,",CD

3608,"standing before her in the little parlour at the back of the shop, one bleak",CD

3609,December morning.,CD

3610,"""If it's Mat whom you care for most,"" I said, ""tell me so in one word, and I",CD

3611,will never trouble you again. He is better worth your love. I am jealous and,CD

3612,"exacting; he is as trusting and unselfish as a woman. Speak, Gianetta; am I to",CD

3613,"bid you good-bye for ever and ever, or am I to write home to my mother in",CD

3614,"England, bidding her pray to God to bless the woman who has promised to be",CD

3615,"my wife?""",CD

3616,"""You plead your friend's cause well,"" she replied, haughtily. ""Matteo",CD

3617,"ought to be grateful. This is more than he ever did for you.""",CD

3618,"""Give me my answer, for pity's sake,"" I exclaimed, ""and let me go!""",CD

3619,"""You are free to go or stay, Signor Inglese,"" she replied. ""I am not your",CD

3620,"jailor.""",CD

3621,"""Do you bid me leave you?""",CD

3622,"""Beata Madre! not I.""",CD

3623,"""Will you marry me, if I stay?""",CD

3624,"She laughed aloud-such a merry, mocking, musical laugh, like a chime of",CD

3625,silver bells!,CD

3626,"""You ask too much,"" she said.",CD

3627,"""Only what you have led me to hope these five or six months past!""",CD

3628,"""That is just what Matteo says. How tiresome you both are!""",CD

3629,"""O, Gianetta,"" I said, passionately, ""be serious for one moment! I am a",CD

3630,"rough fellow, it is true-not half good enough or clever enough for you; but I",CD

3631,"love you with my whole heart, and an Emperor could do no more.""",CD

3632,"""I am glad of it,"" she replied; ""I do not want you to love me less.""",CD

3633,"""Then you cannot wish to make me wretched! Will you promise me?""",CD

3634,"""I promise nothing,"" said she, with another burst of laughter; ""except that I",CD

3635,"will not marry Matteo!""",CD

3636,Except that she would not marry Matteo! Only that. Not a word of hope,CD

3637,"for myself. Nothing but my friend's condemnation. I might get comfort, and",CD

3638,"selfish triumph, and some sort of base assurance out of that, if I could. And so,",CD

3639,"to my shame, I did. I grasped at the vain encouragement, and, fool that I was!",CD

3640,"let her put me off again unanswered. From that day, I gave up all effort at selfcontrol, and let myself drift blindly on-to destruction.",CD

3641,At length things became so bad between Mat and myself that it seemed as,CD

3642,"if an open rupture must be at hand. We avoided each other, scarcely exchanged",CD

3643,"a dozen sentences in a day, and fell away from all our old familiar habits. At",CD

3644,this time-I shudder to remember it!-there were moments when I felt that I,CD

3645,hated him.,CD

3646,"Thus, with the trouble deepening and widening between us day by day,",CD

3647,"another month or five weeks went by; and February came; and, with February,",CD

3648,the Carnival. They said in Genoa that it was a particularly dull carnival; and so,CD

3649,"it must have been; for, save a flag or two hung out in some of the principal",CD

3650,"streets, and a sort of festa look about the women, there were no special",CD

3651,"indications of the season. It was, I think, the second day when, having been on",CD

3652,"the line all the morning, I returned to Genoa at dusk, and, to my surprise,",CD

3653,"found Mat Price on the platform. He came up to me, and laid his hand on my",CD

3654,arm.,CD

3655,"""You are in late,"" he said. ""I have been waiting for you three-quarters of an",CD

3656,"hour. Shall we dine together to-day?""",CD

3657,"Impulsive as I am, this evidence of returning good will at once called up",CD

3658,my better feelings.,CD

3659,"""With all my heart, Mat,"" I replied; ""shall we go to Gozzoli's?""",CD

3660,"""No, no,"" he said, hurriedly. ""Some quieter place-some place where we",CD

3661,"can talk. I have something to say to you.""",CD

3662,"I noticed now that he looked pale and agitated, and an uneasy sense of",CD

3663,"apprehension stole upon me. We decided on the ""Pescatore,"" a little out-ofthe-way trattoria, down near the Molo Vecchio. There, in a dingy salon,",CD

3664,"frequented chiefly by seamen, and redolent of tobacco, we ordered our simple",CD

3665,"dinner. Mat scarcely swallowed a morsel; but, calling presently for a bottle of",CD

3666,"Sicilian wine, drank eagerly.",CD

3667,"""Well, Mat,"" I said, as the last dish was placed on the table, ""what news",CD

3668,"have you?""",CD

3669,"""Bad.""",CD

3670,"""I guessed that from your face.""",CD

3671,"""Bad for you-bad for me. Gianetta.""",CD

3672,"""What of Gianetta?""",CD

3673,He passed his hand nervously across his lips.,CD

3674,"""Gianetta is false-worse than false,"" he said, in a hoarse voice. ""She",CD

3675,values an honest man's heart just as she values a flower for her hair-wears it,CD

3676,"for a day, then throws it aside for ever. She has cruelly wronged us both.""",CD

3677,"""In what way? Good Heavens, speak out!""",CD

3678,"""In the worst way that a woman can wrong those who love her. She has",CD

3679,"sold herself to the Marchese Loredano.""",CD

3680,The blood rushed to my head and face in a burning torrent. I could,CD

3681,"scarcely see, and dared not trust myself to speak.",CD

3682,"""I saw her going towards the cathedral,"" he went on, hurriedly. ""It was",CD

3683,"about three hours ago. I thought she might be going to confession, so I hung",CD

3684,"back and followed her at a distance. When she got inside, however, she went",CD

3685,"straight to the back of the pulpit, where this man was waiting for her. You",CD

3686,remember him-an old man who used to haunt the shop a month or two back.,CD

3687,"Well, seeing how deep in conversation they were, and how they stood close",CD

3688,"under the pulpit with their backs towards the church, I fell into a passion of",CD

3689,"anger and went straight up the aisle, intending to say or do something: I",CD

3690,"scarcely knew what; but, at all events, to draw her arm through mine, and take",CD

3691,"her home. When I came within a few feet, however, and found only a big",CD

3692,"pillar between myself and them, I paused. They could not see me, nor I them;",CD

3693,"but I could hear their voices distinctly, and-and I listened.""",CD

3694,"""Well, and you heard-""",CD

3695,"""The terms of a shameful bargain-beauty on the one side, gold on the",CD

3696,other; so many thousand francs a year; a villa near Naples-Pah! it makes me,CD

3697,"sick to repeat it.""",CD

3698,"And, with a shudder, he poured out another glass of wine and drank it at a",CD

3699,draught.,CD

3700,"""After that,"" he said, presently, ""I made no effort to bring her away. The",CD

3701,"whole thing was so cold-blooded, so deliberate, so shameful, that I felt I had",CD

3702,"only to wipe her out of my memory, and leave her to her fate. I stole out of the",CD

3703,"cathedral, and walked about here by the sea for ever so long, trying to get my",CD

3704,"thoughts straight. Then I remembered you, Ben; and the recollection of how",CD

3705,this wanton had come between us and broken up our lives drove me wild. So I,CD

3706,went up to the station and waited for you. I felt you ought to know it all; and-,CD

3707,"and I thought, perhaps, that we might go back to England together.""",CD

3708,"""The Marchese Loredano!""",CD

3709,It was all that I could say; all that I could think. As Mat had just said of,CD

3710,"himself, I felt ""like one stunned.""",CD

3711,"""There is one other thing I may as well tell you,"" he added, reluctantly, ""if",CD

3712,only to show you how false a woman can be. We-we were to have been,CD

3713,"married next month.""",CD

3714,"""We? Who? What do you mean?""",CD

3715,"""I mean that we were to have been married-Gianetta and I.""",CD

3716,"A sudden storm of rage, of scorn, of incredulity, swept over me at this, and",CD

3717,seemed to carry my senses away.,CD

3718,"""You!"" I cried. ""Gianetta marry you! I don't believe it.""",CD

3719,"""I wish I had not believed it,"" he replied, looking up as if puzzled by my",CD

3720,"vehemence. ""But she promised me; and I thought, when she promised it, she",CD

3721,"meant it.""",CD

3722,"""She told me, weeks ago, that she would never be your wife!""",CD

3723,"His colour rose, his brow darkened; when his answer came, it was as calm",CD

3724,as the last.,CD

3725,"""Indeed!"" he said. ""Then it is only one baseness more. She told me that she",CD

3726,"had refused you; and that was why we kept our engagement secret.""",CD

3734,"He rose, and, laying one hand on the back of his chair, looked me sternly",CD

3735,in the face.,CD

3736,"""If you were not Benjamin Hardy,"" he said, deliberately, ""I would thrash",CD

3737,"you within an inch of your life.""",CD

3738,The words had no sooner passed his lips than I sprang at him. I have never,CD

3739,been able distinctly to remember what followed. A curse-a blow-a struggle,CD

3740,-a moment of blind fury-a cry-a confusion of tongues-a circle of strange,CD

3741,faces. Then I see Mat lying back in the arms of a bystander; myself trembling,CD

3742,and bewildered-the knife dropping from my grasp; blood upon the floor;,CD

3743,blood upon my hands; blood upon his shirt. And then I hear those dreadful,CD

3744,words:,CD

3745,"""O, Ben, you have murdered me!""",CD

3746,"He did not die-at least, not there and then. He was carried to the nearest",CD

3747,"hospital, and lay for some weeks between life and death. His case, they said,",CD

3748,"was difficult and dangerous. The knife had gone in just below the collarbone,",CD

3749,and pierced down into the lungs. He was not allowed to speak or turn-,CD

3750,scarcely to breathe with freedom. He might not even lift his head to drink. I sat,CD

3751,by him day and night all through that sorrowful time. I gave up my situation,CD

3752,on the railway; I quitted my lodging in the Vicolo Balba; I tried to forget that,CD

3753,such a woman as Gianetta Coneglia had ever drawn breath. I lived only for,CD

3754,"Mat; and he tried to live more, I believe, for my sake than his own. Thus, in",CD

3755,"the bitter silent hours of pain and penitence, when no hand but mine",CD

3756,"approached his lips or smoothed his pillow, the old friendship came back with",CD

3757,"even more than its old trust and faithfulness. He forgave me, fully and freely;",CD

3758,and I would thankfully have given my life for him.,CD

3759,"At length there came one bright spring morning, when, dismissed as",CD

3760,"convalescent, he tottered out through the hospital gates, leaning on my arm,",CD

3761,"and feeble as an infant. He was not cured; neither, as I then learned to my",CD

3762,"horror and anguish, was it possible that he ever could be cured. He might live,",CD

3763,"with care, for some years; but the lungs were injured beyond hope of remedy,",CD

3764,"and a strong or healthy man he could never be again. These, spoken aside to",CD

3765,"me, were the parting words of the chief physician, who advised me to take him",CD

3766,further south without delay.,CD

3767,"I took him to a little coast-town called Rocca, some thirty miles beyond",CD

3768,"Genoa-a sheltered lonely place along the Riviera, where the sea was even",CD

3769,"bluer than the sky, and the cliffs were green with strange tropical plants, cacti,",CD

3770,"and aloes, and Egyptian palms. Here we lodged in the house of a small",CD

3771,"tradesman; and Mat, to use his own words, ""set to work at getting well in good",CD

3772,"earnest."" But, alas! it was a work which no earnestness could forward. Day",CD

3773,"after day he went down to the beach, and sat for hours drinking the sea air and",CD

3774,watching the sails that came and went in the offing. By-and-by he could go no,CD

3775,"further than the garden of the house in which we lived. A little later, and he",CD

3776,"spent his days on a couch beside the open window, waiting patiently for the",CD

3777,"end. Ay, for the end! It had come to that. He was fading fast, waning with the",CD

3778,"waning summer, and conscious that the Reaper was at hand. His whole aim",CD

3779,"now was to soften the agony of my remorse, and prepare me for what must",CD

3780,shortly come.,CD

3781,"""I would not live longer, if I could,"" he said, lying on his couch one",CD

3782,"summer evening, and looking up to the stars. ""If I had my choice at this",CD

3783,"moment, I would ask to go. I should like Gianetta to know that I forgave her.""",CD

3784,"""She shall know it,"" I said, trembling suddenly from head to foot.",CD

3785,He pressed my hand.,CD

3786,"""And you'll write to father?""",CD

3787,"""I will.""",CD

3788,"I had drawn a little back, that he might not see the tears raining down my",CD

3789,"cheeks; but he raised himself on his elbow, and looked round.",CD

3790,"""Don't fret, Ben,"" he whispered; laid his head back wearily upon the",CD

3791,pillow-and so died.,CD

3792,And this was the end of it. This was the end of all that made life life to me.,CD

3793,"I buried him there, in hearing of the wash of a strange sea on a strange shore. I",CD

3794,stayed by the grave till the priest and the bystanders were gone. I saw the earth,CD

3795,"filled in to the last sod, and the gravedigger stamp it down with his feet. Then,",CD

3796,"and not till then, I felt that I had lost him for ever-the friend I had loved, and",CD

3797,"hated, and slain. Then, and not till then, I knew that all rest, and joy, and hope",CD

3798,"were over for me. From that moment my heart hardened within me, and my",CD

3799,"life was filled with loathing. Day and night, land and sea, labour and rest, food",CD

3800,"and sleep, were alike hateful to me. It was the curse of Cain, and that my",CD

3801,brother had pardoned me made it lie none the lighter. Peace on earth was for,CD

3802,"me no more, and goodwill towards men was dead in my heart for ever.",CD

3803,Remorse softens some natures; but it poisoned mine. I hated all mankind; but,CD

3804,"above all mankind I hated the woman who had come between us two, and",CD

3805,ruined both our lives.,CD

3806,"He had bidden me seek her out, and be the messenger of his forgiveness. I",CD

3807,had sooner have gone down to the port of Genoa and taken upon me the serge,CD

3808,cap and shotted chain of any galley-slave at his toil in the public works; but,CD

3809,"for all that I did my best to obey him. I went back, alone and on foot. I went",CD

3810,"back, intending to say to her, ""Gianetta Coneglia, he forgave you; but God",CD

3811,"never will."" But she was gone. The little shop was let to a fresh occupant; and",CD

3812,the neighbours only knew that mother and daughter had left the place quite,CD

3813,"suddenly, and that Gianetta was supposed to be under the ""protection"" of the",CD

3814,Marchese Loredano. How I made inquiries here and there-how I heard that,CD

3815,"they had gone to Naples-and how, being restless and reckless of my time, I",CD

3816,"worked my passage in a French steamer, and followed her-how, having",CD

3817,"found the sumptuous villa that was now hers, I learned that she had left there",CD

3818,"some ten days and gone to Paris, where the Marchese was ambassador for the",CD

3819,"Two Sicilies-how, working my passage back again to Marseilles, and thence,",CD

3820,"in part by the river and in part by the rail, I made my way to Paris-how, day",CD

3821,"after day, I paced the streets and the parks, watched at the ambassador's gates,",CD

3822,"followed his carriage, and at last, after weeks of waiting, discovered her",CD

3823,"address-how, having written to request an interview, her servants spurned me",CD

3824,"from her door and flung my letter in my face-how, looking up at her",CD

3825,"windows, I then, instead of forgiving, solemnly cursed her with the bitterest",CD

3826,"curses my tongue could devise-and how, this done, I shook the dust of Paris",CD

3827,"from my feet, and became a wanderer upon the face of the earth, are facts",CD

3828,which I have now no space to tell.,CD

3829,The next six or eight years of my life were shifting and unsettled enough.,CD

3830,"A morose and restless man, I took employment here and there, as opportunity",CD

3831,"offered, turning my hand to many things, and caring little what I earned, so",CD

3832,long as the work was hard and the change incessant. First of all I engaged,CD

3833,myself as chief engineer in one of the French steamers plying between,CD

3834,Marseilles and Constantinople. At Constantinople I changed to one of the,CD

3835,"Austrian Lloyd's boats, and worked for some time to and from Alexandria,",CD

3836,"Jaffa, and those parts. After that, I fell in with a party of Mr. Layard's men at",CD

3837,"Cairo, and so went up the Nile and took a turn at the excavations of the mound",CD

3838,of Nimroud. Then I became a working engineer on the new desert line,CD

3839,between Alexandria and Suez; and by-and-by I worked my passage out to,CD

3840,"Bombay, and took service as an engine fitter on one of the great Indian",CD

3841,"railways. I stayed a long time in India; that is to say, I stayed nearly two years,",CD

3842,"which was a long time for me; and I might not even have left so soon, but for",CD

3843,the war that was declared just then with Russia. That tempted me. For I loved,CD

3844,"danger and hardship as other men love safety and ease; and as for my life, I",CD

3845,"had sooner have parted from it than kept it, any day. So I came straight back to",CD

3846,"England; betook myself to Portsmouth, where my testimonials at once",CD

3847,procured me the sort of berth I wanted. I went out to the Crimea in the engineroom of one of her Majesty's war steamers.,CD

3848,"I served with the fleet, of course, while the war lasted; and when it was",CD

3849,"over, went wandering off again, rejoicing in my liberty. This time I went to",CD

3850,"Canada, and after working on a railway then in progress near the American",CD

3851,"frontier, I presently passed over into the States; journeyed from north to south;",CD

3852,crossed the Rocky Mountains; tried a month or two of life in the gold country;,CD

3853,"and then, being seized with a sudden, aching, unaccountable longing to revisit",CD

3854,"that solitary grave so far away on the Italian coast, I turned my face once more",CD

3855,towards Europe.,CD

3856,"Poor little grave! I found it rank with weeds, the cross half shattered, the",CD

3857,"inscription half effaced. It was as if no one had loved him, or remembered",CD

3858,him. I went back to the house in which we had lodged together. The same,CD

3859,"people were still living there, and made me kindly welcome. I stayed with",CD

3860,"them for some weeks. I weeded, and planted, and trimmed the grave with my",CD

3861,"own hands, and set up a fresh cross in pure white marble. It was the first",CD

3862,season of rest that I had known since I laid him there; and when at last I,CD

3863,"shouldered my knapsack and set forth again to battle with the world, I",CD

3864,"promised myself that, God willing, I would creep back to Rocca, when my",CD

3865,"days drew near to ending, and be buried by his side.",CD

3866,"From hence, being, perhaps, a little less inclined than formerly for very",CD

3867,"distant parts, and willing to keep within reach of that grave, I went no further",CD

3868,"than Mantua, where I engaged myself as an engine-driver on the line, then not",CD

3869,"long completed, between that city and Venice. Somehow, although I had been",CD

3870,"trained to the working engineering, I preferred in these days to earn my bread",CD

3871,"by driving. I liked the excitement of it, the sense of power, the rush of the air,",CD

3872,"the roar of the fire, the flitting of the landscape. Above all, I enjoyed to drive a",CD

3873,"night express. The worse the weather, the better it suited with my sullen",CD

3874,"temper. For I was as hard, and harder than ever. The years had done nothing to",CD

3875,soften me. They had only confirmed all that was blackest and bitterest in my,CD

3876,heart.,CD

3877,"I continued pretty faithful to the Mantua line, and had been working on it",CD

3878,steadily for more than seven months when that which I am now about to relate,CD

3879,took place.,CD

3880,It was in the month of March. The weather had been unsettled for some,CD

3881,"days past, and the nights stormy; and at one point along the line, near Ponte di",CD

3882,"Brenta, the waters had risen and swept away some seventy yards of",CD

3883,"embankment. Since this accident, the trains had all been obliged to stop at a",CD

3884,"certain spot between Padua and Ponte di Brenta, and the passengers, with their",CD

3885,"luggage, had thence to be transported in all kinds of vehicles, by a circuitous",CD

3886,"country road, to the nearest station on the other side of the gap, where another",CD

3887,"train and engine awaited them. This, of course, caused great confusion and",CD

3888,"annoyance, put all our time-tables wrong, and subjected the public to a large",CD

3889,amount of inconvenience. In the meanwhile an army of navvies was drafted to,CD

3890,"the spot, and worked day and night to repair the damage. At this time I was",CD

3891,"driving two through trains each day; namely, one from Mantua to Venice in the",CD

3892,"early morning, and a return train from Venice to Mantua in the afternoon-a",CD

3893,"tolerably full day's work, covering about one hundred and ninety miles of",CD

3894,"ground, and occupying between ten and eleven hours. I was therefore not best",CD

3895,"pleased when, on the third or fourth day after the accident, I was informed",CD

3896,"that, in addition to my regular allowance of work, I should that evening be",CD

3897,"required to drive a special train to Venice. This special train, consisting of an",CD

3898,"engine, a single carriage, and a break-van, was to leave the Mantua platform at",CD

3899,eleven; at Padua the passengers were to alight and find post-chaises waiting to,CD

3900,"convey them to Ponte di Brenta; at Ponte di Brenta another engine, carriage,",CD

3901,and break-van were to be in readiness. I was charged to accompany them,CD

3902,throughout.,CD

3903,"""Corpo di Bacco,"" said the clerk who gave me my orders, ""you need not",CD

3904,"look so black, man. You are certain of a handsome gratuity. Do you know who",CD

3905,"goes with you?""",CD

3906,"""Not I.""",CD

3907,"""Not you, indeed! Why, it's the Duca Loredano, the Neapolitan",CD

3908,"ambassador.""",CD

3909,"""Loredano!"" I stammered. ""What Loredano? There was a Marchese-""",CD

3910,"""Certo. He was the Marchese Loredano some years ago; but he has come",CD

3911,"into his dukedom since then.""",CD

3912,"""He must be a very old man by this time.""",CD

3913,"""Yes, he is old; but what of that? He is as hale, and bright, and stately as",CD

3914,"ever. You have seen him before?""",CD

3915,"""Yes,"" I said, turning away; ""I have seen him-years ago.""",CD

3916,"""You have heard of his marriage?""",CD

3917,I shook my head.,CD

3918,"The clerk chuckled, rubbed his hands, and shrugged his shoulders.",CD

3919,"""An extraordinary affair,"" he said. ""Made a tremendous esclandre at the",CD

3920,"time. He married his mistress-quite a common, vulgar girl-a Genoese-",CD

3921,"very handsome; but not received, of course. Nobody visits her.""",CD

3922,"""Married her!"" I exclaimed. ""Impossible.""",CD

3923,"""True, I assure you.""",CD

3924,I put my hand to my head. I felt as if I had had a fall or a blow.,CD

3925,"""Does she-does she go to-night?"" I faltered.",CD

3926,"""O dear, yes-goes everywhere with him-never lets him out of her sight.",CD

3927,"You'll see her-la bella Duchessa!""",CD

3928,"With this my informant laughed, and rubbed his hands again, and went",CD

3929,back to his office.,CD

3930,"The day went by, I scarcely know how, except that my whole soul was in a",CD

3931,"tumult of rage and bitterness. I returned from my afternoon's work about 7.25,",CD

3932,and at 10.30 I was once again at the station. I had examined the engine; given,CD

3933,"instructions to the Fochista, or stoker, about the fire; seen to the supply of oil;",CD

3934,"and got all in readiness, when, just as I was about to compare my watch with",CD

3935,"the clock in the ticket-office, a hand was laid upon my arm, and a voice in my",CD

3936,ear said:,CD

3937,"""Are you the engine-driver who is going on with this special train?""",CD

3938,"I had never seen the speaker before. He was a small, dark man, muffled up",CD

3939,"about the throat, with blue glasses, a large black beard, and his hat drawn low",CD

3940,upon his eyes.,CD

3941,"""You are a poor man, I suppose,"" he said, in a quick, eager whisper, ""and,",CD

3942,"like other poor men, would not object to be better off. Would you like to earn a",CD

3943,"couple of thousand florins?""",CD

3944,"""In what way?""",CD

3945,"""Hush! You are to stop at Padua, are you not, and to go on again at Ponte",CD

3946,"di Brenta?""",CD

3947,I nodded.,CD

3948,"""Suppose you did nothing of the kind. Suppose, instead of turning off the",CD

3949,"steam, you jump off the engine, and let the train run on?""",CD

3950,"""Impossible. There are seventy yards of embankment gone, and-""",CD

3951,"""Basta! I know that. Save yourself, and let the train run on. It would be",CD

3952,"nothing but an accident.""",CD

3953,"I turned hot and cold; I trembled; my heart beat fast, and my breath failed.",CD

3954,"""Why do you tempt me?"" I faltered.",CD

3955,"""For Italy's sake,"" he whispered; ""for liberty's sake. I know you are no",CD

3956,"Italian; but, for all that, you may be a friend. This Loredano is one of his",CD

3957,"country's bitterest enemies. Stay, here are the two thousand florins.""",CD

3958,I thrust his hand back fiercely.,CD

3959,"""No-no,"" I said. ""No blood-money. If I do it, I do it neither for Italy nor",CD

3960,"for money; but for vengeance.""",CD

3961,"""For vengeance!"" he repeated.",CD

3962,At this moment the signal was given for backing up to the platform. I,CD

3963,sprang to my place upon the engine without another word. When I again,CD

3964,"looked towards the spot where he had been standing, the stranger was gone.",CD

3965,"I saw them take their places-Duke and Duchess, secretary and priest,",CD

3966,"valet and maid. I saw the station-master bow them into the carriage, and stand,",CD

3967,"bareheaded, beside the door. I could not distinguish their faces; the platform",CD

3968,"was too dusk, and the glare from the engine fire too strong; but I recognised",CD

3969,"her stately figure, and the poise of her head. Had I not been told who she was,",CD

3970,I should have known her by those traits alone. Then the guard's whistle,CD

3971,"shrilled out, and the station-master made his last bow; I turned the steam on;",CD

3972,and we started.,CD

3973,My blood was on fire. I no longer trembled or hesitated. I felt as if every,CD

3974,"nerve was iron, and every pulse instinct with deadly purpose. She was in my",CD

3975,"power, and I would be revenged. She should die-she, for whom I had stained",CD

3976,"my soul with my friend's blood! She should die, in the plenitude of her wealth",CD

3977,"and her beauty, and no power upon earth should save her!",CD

3978,The stations flew past. I put on more steam; I bade the fireman heap in the,CD

3979,"coke, and stir the blazing mass. I would have outstripped the wind, had it been",CD

3980,"possible. Faster and faster-hedges and trees, bridges and stations, flashing",CD

3981,"past-villages no sooner seen than gone-telegraph wires twisting, and",CD

3982,"dipping, and twining themselves in one, with the awful swiftness of our pace!",CD

3983,"Faster and faster, till the fireman at my side looks white and scared, and",CD

3984,"refuses to add more fuel to the furnace. Faster and faster, till the wind rushes",CD

3985,in our faces and drives the breath back upon our lips.,CD

3986,I would have scorned to save myself. I meant to die with the rest. Mad as I,CD

3987,was-and I believe from my very soul that I was utterly mad for the time-I,CD

3988,felt a passing pang of pity for the old man and his suite. I would have spared,CD

3989,"the poor fellow at my side, too, if I could; but the pace at which we were going",CD

3990,made escape impossible.,CD

3991,Vicenza was passed-a mere confused vision of lights. Pojana flew by. At,CD

3992,"Padua, but nine miles distant, our passengers were to alight. I saw the",CD

3993,"fireman's face turned upon me in remonstrance; I saw his lips move, though I",CD

3994,could not hear a word; I saw his expression change suddenly from,CD

3995,"remonstrance to a deadly terror, and then-merciful Heaven! then, for the first",CD

3996,"time, I saw that he and I were no longer alone upon the engine.",CD

3997,"There was a third man-a third man standing on my right hand, as the",CD

3998,"fireman was standing on my left-a tall, stalwart man, with short curling hair,",CD

3999,and a flat Scotch cap upon his head. As I fell back in the first shock of,CD

4000,"surprise, he stepped nearer; took my place at the engine, and turned the steam",CD

4001,"off. I opened my lips to speak to him; he turned his head slowly, and looked",CD

4002,me in the face.,CD

4003,Matthew Price!,CD

4004,"I uttered one long wild cry, flung my arms wildly up above my head, and",CD

4005,fell as if I had been smitten with an axe.,CD

4006,"I am prepared for the objections that may be made to my story. I expect, as",CD

4007,"a matter of course, to be told that this was an optical illusion, or that I was",CD

4008,"suffering from pressure on the brain, or even that I laboured under an attack of",CD

4009,"temporary insanity. I have heard all these arguments before, and, if I may be",CD

4010,"forgiven for saying so, I have no desire to hear them again. My own mind has",CD

4011,been made up upon this subject for many a year. All that I can say-all that I,CD

4012,know is-that Matthew Price came back from the dead to save my soul and the,CD

4013,"lives of those whom I, in my guilty rage, would have hurried to destruction. I",CD

4014,believe this as I believe in the mercy of Heaven and the forgiveness of,CD

4015,repentant sinners.,CD

4018,in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninetytwo. More,CD

4019,"than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad horses, he would have",CD

4020,"encountered to delay him, though the fallen and unfortunate King of France",CD

4021,"had been upon his throne in all his glory; but, the changed times were fraught",CD

4022,with other obstacles than these. Every towngate and village taxinghouse had,CD

4023,"its band of citizenpatriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state",CD

4024,"of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, crossquestioned them,",CD

4025,"inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them",CD

4026,"back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their",CD

4027,capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and,CD

4028,"Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.",CD

4029,"A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles",CD

4030,Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no,CD

4031,hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris.,CD

4032,"Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey's end. Not a mean",CD

4033,"village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across the road behind",CD

4034,"him, but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred",CD

4035,"between him and England. The universal watchfulness so encompassed him,",CD

4036,"that if he had been taken in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in",CD

4037,"a cage, he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone.",CD

4038,This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty,CD

4039,"times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by riding after",CD

4040,"him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him by anticipation,",CD

4041,riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been days upon his,CD

4042,"journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in a little town on the",CD

4043,"high road, still a long way from Paris.",CD

4044,Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his prison of,CD

4045,the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the guardhouse in,CD

4046,"this small place had been such, that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis.",CD

4047,"And he was, therefore, as little surprised as a man could be, to find himself",CD

4048,"awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning, in the",CD

4049,middle of the night.,CD

4050,Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red,CD

4051,"caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.",CD

4052,"""Emigrant,"" said the functionary, ""I am going to send you on to Paris, under an",CD

4053,"escort.""",CD

4054,"""Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could dispense",CD

4055,"with the escort.""",CD

4056,"""Silence!"" growled a redcap, striking at the coverlet with the buttend of his",CD

4057,"musket. ""Peace, aristocrat!""",CD

4058,"""It is as the good patriot says,"" observed the timid functionary. ""You are an",CD

4059,"aristocrat, and must have an escortand must pay for it.""",CD

4060,"""I have no choice,"" said Charles Darnay.",CD

4061,"""Choice! Listen to him!"" cried the same scowling redcap. ""As if it was not a",CD

4062,"favour to be protected from the lampiron!""",CD

4063,"""It is always as the good patriot says,"" observed the functionary. ""Rise and",CD

4064,"dress yourself, emigrant.""",CD

4065,"Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guardhouse, where other patriots",CD

4066,"in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by a watchfire. Here",CD

4067,"he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he started with it on the wet,",CD

4068,wet roads at three o'clock in the morning.,CD

4069,"The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tricoloured cockades,",CD

4070,"armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either side of him.",CD

4071,"The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to his",CD

4072,"bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist. In this",CD

4073,state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces: clattering at a,CD

4074,"heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement, and out upon the",CD

4075,"miredeep roads. In this state they traversed without change, except of horses",CD

4076,"and pace, all the miredeep leagues that lay between them and the capital.",CD

4077,"They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and lying by",CD

4078,"until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed, that they twisted",CD

4079,"straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the",CD

4080,"wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended, and apart",CD

4081,from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots,CD

4082,"being chronically drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, Charles",CD

4083,Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any,CD

4084,"serious fears in his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no",CD

4085,"reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of",CD

4086,"representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet",CD

4087,made.,CD

4088,"But when they came to the town of Beauvaiswhich they did at eventide, when",CD

4089,the streets were filled with peoplehe could not conceal from himself that the,CD

4090,aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd gathered to see him,CD

4091,"dismount of the postingyard, and many voices called out loudly, ""Down with",CD

4092,"the emigrant!""",CD

4093,"He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and, resuming it as",CD

4094,"his safest place, said:",CD

4095,"""Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own will?""",CD

4096,"""You are a cursed emigrant,"" cried a farrier, making at him in a furious manner",CD

4097,"through the press, hammer in hand; ""and you are a cursed aristocrat!""",CD

4098,The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's bridle (at,CD

4099,"which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, ""Let him be; let him be!",CD

4100,"He will be judged at Paris.""",CD

4101,"""Judged!"" repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. ""Ay! and condemned as a",CD

4102,"traitor."" At this the crowd roared approval.",CD

4103,"Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse's head to the yard (the",CD

4104,"drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with the line round",CD

4105,"his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his voice heard:",CD

4106,"""Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a traitor.""",CD

4107,"""He lies!"" cried the smith. ""He is a traitor since the decree. His life is forfeit to",CD

4108,"the people. His cursed life is not his own!""",CD

4109,"At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which another",CD

4110,"instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his horse into the",CD

4111,"yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks, and the postmaster shut",CD

4112,and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier struck a blow upon them with,CD

4113,"his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no more was done.",CD

4114,"""What is this decree that the smith spoke of?"" Darnay asked the postmaster,",CD

4115,"when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.",CD

4116,"""Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.""",CD

4117,"""When passed?""",CD

4118,"""On the fourteenth.""",CD

4119,"""The day I left England!""",CD

4120,"""Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be othersif there",CD

4121,"are not alreadybanishing all emigrants, and condemning all to death who",CD

4122,"return. That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own.""",CD

4123,"""But there are no such decrees yet?""",CD

4124,"""What do I know!"" said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; ""there may",CD

4125,"be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?""",CD

4126,"They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and then rode",CD

4127,forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many wild changes,CD

4128,"observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal, not the least",CD

4129,was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and lonely spurring over dreary,CD

4130,"roads, they would come to a cluster of poor cottages, not steeped in darkness,",CD

4131,"but all glittering with lights, and would find the people, in a ghostly manner in",CD

4132,"the dead of the night, circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty,",CD

4133,"or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was",CD

4134,sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once,CD

4135,"more into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and wet,",CD

4136,"among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year,",CD

4137,"diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by the sudden",CD

4138,"emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their way, of patriot",CD

4139,patrols on the watch on all the roads.,CD

4140,Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was closed,CD

4141,and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.,CD

4142,"""Where are the papers of this prisoner?"" demanded a resolutelooking man in",CD

4143,"authority, who was summoned out by the guard.",CD

4144,"Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the",CD

4145,"speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen, in charge",CD

4146,"of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him,",CD

4147,and which he had paid for.,CD

4148,"""Where,"" repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him",CD

4149,"whatever, ""are the papers of this prisoner?""",CD

4150,"The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his eyes",CD

4151,"over Gabelle's letter, the same personage in authority showed some disorder",CD

4152,"and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.",CD

4153,"He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went into the",CD

4154,"guardroom; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the gate. Looking",CD

4155,"about him while in this state of suspense, Charles Darnay observed that the",CD

4156,"gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots, the latter far",CD

4157,outnumbering the former; and that while ingress into the city for peasants',CD

4158,"carts bringing in supplies, and for similar traffic and traffickers, was easy",CD

4159,"enough, egress, even for the homeliest people, was very difficult. A numerous",CD

4160,"medley of men and women, not to mention beasts and vehicles of various",CD

4161,"sorts, was waiting to issue forth; but, the previous identification was so strict,",CD

4162,that they filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew,CD

4163,"their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the ground to",CD

4164,"sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered about. The red cap",CD

4165,"and tricolour cockade were universal, both among men and women.",CD

4166,"When he had sat in his saddle some halfhour, taking note of these things,",CD

4167,"Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority, who directed",CD

4168,"the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the escort, drunk and sober,",CD

4169,"a receipt for the escorted, and requested him to dismount. He did so, and the",CD

4170,"two patriots, leading his tired horse, turned and rode away without entering the",CD

4171,city.,CD

4172,"He accompanied his conductor into a guardroom, smelling of common wine",CD

4173,"and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake, drunk and",CD

4174,"sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking, drunkenness",CD

4175,"and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The light in the guardhouse, half",CD

4176,"derived from the waning oillamps of the night, and half from the overcast day,",CD

4177,was in a correspondingly uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open,CD

4178,"on a desk, and an officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.",CD

4179,"""Citizen Defarge,"" said he to Darnay's conductor, as he took a slip of paper to",CD

4180,"write on. ""Is this the emigrant Evremonde?""",CD

4181,"""This is the man.""",CD

4182,"""Your age, Evremonde?""",CD

4183,"""Thirtyseven.""",CD

4184,"""Married, Evremonde?""",CD

4185,"""Yes.""",CD

4186,"""Where married?""",CD

4187,"""In England.""",CD

4188,"""Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?""",CD

4189,"""In England.""",CD

4190,"""Without doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La Force.""",CD

4191,"""Just Heaven!"" exclaimed Darnay. ""Under what law, and for what offence?""",CD

4192,The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.,CD

4193,"""We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here."" He",CD

4194,"said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.",CD

4195,"""I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response to that",CD

4196,written appeal of a fellowcountryman which lies before you. I demand no,CD

4197,"more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that my right?""",CD

4198,"""Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde,"" was the stolid reply. The officer",CD

4199,"wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written, sanded",CD

4200,"it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words ""In secret.""",CD

4201,Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him.,CD

4202,"The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended them.",CD

4203,"""Is it you,"" said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the guardhouse",CD

4204,"steps and turned into Paris, ""who married the daughter of Doctor Manette,",CD

4205,"once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?""",CD

4206,"""Yes,"" replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.",CD

4207,"""My name is Defarge, and I keep a wineshop in the Quarter Saint Antoine.",CD

4208,"Possibly you have heard of me.""",CD

4209,"""My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!""",CD

4210,"The word ""wife"" seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say",CD

4211,"with sudden impatience, ""In the name of that sharp female newlyborn, and",CD

4212,"called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?""",CD

4213,"""You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the truth?""",CD

4214,"""A bad truth for you,"" said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and looking",CD

4215,straight before him.,CD

4216,"""Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so sudden",CD

4217,"and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a little help?""",CD

4218,"""None."" Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.",CD

4219,"""Will you answer me a single question?""",CD

4220,"""Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.""",CD

4221,"""In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free",CD

4222,"communication with the world outside?""",CD

4223,"""You will see.""",CD

4224,"""I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of presenting",CD

4225,"my case?""",CD

4226,"""You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried in",CD

4227,"worse prisons, before now.""",CD

4228,"""But never by me, Citizen Defarge.""",CD

4229,"Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady and set",CD

4230,"silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope there wasor so",CD

4231,"Darnay thoughtof his softening in any slight degree. He, therefore, made haste",CD

4232,to say:,CD

4233,"""It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better than I, of",CD

4234,"how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to Mr. Lorry of",CD

4235,"Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris, the simple fact,",CD

4236,"without comment, that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force. Will",CD

4237,"you cause that to be done for me?""",CD

4238,"""I will do,"" Defarge doggedly rejoined, ""nothing for you. My duty is to my",CD

4239,"country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you. I will do",CD

4240,"nothing for you.""",CD

4241,"Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride was",CD

4242,"touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see how used",CD

4243,the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets. The,CD

4244,"very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned their heads, and a",CD

4245,"few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat; otherwise, that a man in good",CD

4246,"clothes should be going to prison, was no more remarkable than that a labourer",CD

4247,"in working clothes should be going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty",CD

4248,"street through which they passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was",CD

4249,"addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people, of the king",CD

4250,"and the royal family. The few words that he caught from this man's lips, first",CD

4251,"made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the",CD

4252,foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at,CD

4253,Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal,CD

4254,watchfulness had completely isolated him.,CD

4255,That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed,CD

4256,"themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That perils had",CD

4257,"thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster yet, he of course",CD

4258,knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this,CD

4259,"journey, if he could have foreseen the events of a few days. And yet his",CD

4260,"misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by the light of this later time, they",CD

4261,"would appear. Troubled as the future was, it was the unknown future, and in its",CD

4262,"obscurity there was ignorant hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights",CD

4263,"long, which, within a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood",CD

4264,"upon the blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as",CD

4265,"if it had been a hundred thousand years away. The ""sharp female newlyborn,",CD

4266,"and called La Guillotine,"" was hardly known to him, or to the generality of",CD

4267,"people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were probably",CD

4268,unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could they have a,CD

4269,place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?,CD

4270,"Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation from his",CD

4271,"wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the certainty; but, beyond",CD

4272,"this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on his mind, which was enough",CD

4273,"to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he arrived at the prison of La Force.",CD

4274,"A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge",CD

4275,"presented ""The Emigrant Evremonde.""",CD

4276,"""What the Devil! How many more of them!"" exclaimed the man with the",CD

4277,bloated face.,CD

4278,"Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew, with",CD

4279,his two fellowpatriots.,CD

4280,"""What the Devil, I say again!"" exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife. ""How",CD

4281,"many more!""",CD

4282,"The gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely",CD

4283,"replied, ""One must have patience, my dear!"" Three turnkeys who entered",CD

4284,"responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, ""For the",CD

4285,"love of Liberty;"" which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion.",CD

4286,"The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a",CD

4287,horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour,CD

4288,"of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for!",CD

4289,"""In secret, too,"" grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. ""As if I was",CD

4290,"not already full to bursting!""",CD

4291,"He stuck the paper on a file, in an illhumour, and Charles Darnay awaited his",CD

4292,"further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and fro in the strong",CD

4293,"arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in either case detained to be",CD

4294,imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates.,CD

4295,"""Come!"" said the chief, at length taking up his keys, ""come with me,",CD

4296,"emigrant.""",CD

4297,"Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by",CD

4298,"corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them, until",CD

4299,"they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both",CD

4300,"sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading and writing, knitting,",CD

4301,"sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the most part standing behind",CD

4302,"their chairs, or lingering up and down the room.",CD

4303,"In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace,",CD

4304,the newcomer recoiled from this company. But the crowning unreality of his,CD

4305,"long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive him, with every",CD

4306,"refinement of manner known to the time, and with all the engaging graces and",CD

4307,courtesies of life.,CD

4308,So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and,CD

4309,"gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery",CD

4310,"through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a",CD

4311,"company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost of stateliness,",CD

4314,"desolate shore, all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they",CD

4315,had died in coming there.,CD

4318,"ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted",CD

4321,delicately bredthat the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the,CD

4323,"Surely, the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to",CD

4324,these gloomy shades!,CD

4325,"""In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,"" said a gentleman of",CD

4326,"courtly appearance and address, coming forward, ""I have the honour of giving",CD

4327,"you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you on the calamity that has",CD

4329,"impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?""",CD

4330,"Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in words as",CD

4331,suitable as he could find.,CD

4332,"""But I hope,"" said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his eyes, who",CD

4333,"moved across the room, ""that you are not in secret?""",CD

4334,"""I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say so.""",CD

4335,"""Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several members of",CD

4336,"our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted but a short time.""",CD

4337,"Then he added, raising his voice, ""I grieve to inform the societyin secret.""",CD

4338,There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to,CD

4339,"a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voicesamong which,",CD

4340,the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuousgave him good,CD

4341,"wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to render the thanks",CD

4342,of his heart; it closed under the gaoler's hand; and the apparitions vanished,CD

4343,from his sight forever.,CD

4344,"The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had",CD

4345,"ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted them), the",CD

4346,"gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a solitary cell. It struck",CD

4347,"cold and damp, but was not dark.",CD

4348,"""Yours,"" said the gaoler.",CD

4349,"""Why am I confined alone?""",CD

4350,"""How do I know!""",CD

4351,"""I can buy pen, ink, and paper?""",CD

4352,"""Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At present, you",CD

4353,"may buy your food, and nothing more.""",CD

4354,"There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As the gaoler",CD

4355,"made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four walls, before going",CD

4356,"out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning",CD

4357,"against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler was so unwholesomely",CD

4358,"bloated, both in face and person, as to look like a man who had been drowned",CD

4359,"and filled with water. When the gaoler was gone, he thought in the same",CD

4360,"wandering way, ""Now am I left, as if I were dead."" Stopping then, to look",CD

4361,"down at the mattress, he turned from it with a sick feeling, and thought, ""And",CD

4362,"here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death.""",CD

4363,"""Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five paces by four",CD

4364,"and a half."" The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell, counting its",CD

4365,"measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild",CD

4366,"swell of voices added to them. ""He made shoes, he made shoes, he made",CD

4367,"shoes."" The prisoner counted the measurement again, and paced faster, to draw",CD

4368,"his mind with him from that latter repetition. ""The ghosts that vanished when",CD

4369,"the wicket closed. There was one among them, the appearance of a lady",CD

4370,"dressed in black, who was leaning in the embrasure of a window, and she had",CD

4371,"a light shining upon her golden hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on",CD

4372,"again, for God's sake, through the illuminated villages with the people all",CD

4373,"awake! * * * * He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five",CD

4374,"paces by four and a half."" With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from",CD

4375,"the depths of his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately",CD

4376,counting and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extentthat it still,CD

4377,"rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he knew, in the",CD

4378,swell that rose above them.,CD

4379,II.,CD

4380,The Grindstone,CD

4381,"Tellson's Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was in a",CD

4382,"wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street",CD

4383,by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to a great nobleman who,CD

4384,"had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles, in his own cook's dress,",CD

4385,"and got across the borders. A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he",CD

4386,"was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the",CD

4387,preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong,CD

4388,men besides the cook in question.,CD

4389,"Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the",CD

4390,"sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and willing to",CD

4391,cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of,CD

4392,"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's house had been first",CD

4393,"sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all things moved so fast, and decree",CD

4394,"followed decree with that fierce precipitation, that now upon the third night of",CD

4395,"the autumn month of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in",CD

4396,"possession of Monseigneur's house, and had marked it with the tricolour, and",CD

4397,were drinking brandy in its state apartments.,CD

4398,"A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris, would",CD

4399,"soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette. For, what",CD

4400,would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orangetrees in,CD

4401,"boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid over the counter? Yet such",CD

4402,"things were. Tellson's had whitewashed the Cupid, but he was still to be seen",CD

4403,"on the ceiling, in the coolest linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money",CD

4404,from morning to night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young,CD

4405,"Pagan, in Lombardstreet, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of",CD

4406,"the immortal boy, and also of a lookingglass let into the wall, and also of",CD

4407,"clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest provocation. Yet, a",CD

4408,"French Tellson's could get on with these things exceedingly well, and, as long",CD

4409,"as the times held together, no man had taken fright at them, and drawn out his",CD

4410,money.,CD

4411,"What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would lie",CD

4412,"there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson's",CD

4413,"hidingplaces, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and when they should",CD

4414,have violently perished; how many accounts with Tellson's never to be,CD

4415,"balanced in this world, must be carried over into the next; no man could have",CD

4416,"said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis Lorry could, though he thought",CD

4417,heavily of these questions. He sat by a newlylighted wood fire (the blighted,CD

4418,"and unfruitful year was prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous",CD

4419,"face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any",CD

4420,object in the room distortedly reflecta shade of horror.,CD

4421,"He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which he had",CD

4422,"grown to be a part, like strong rootivy. It chanced that they derived a kind of",CD

4423,"security from the patriotic occupation of the main building, but the truehearted",CD

4424,old gentleman never calculated about that. All such circumstances were,CD

4425,"indifferent to him, so that he did his duty. On the opposite side of the",CD

4426,"courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive standingfor carriageswhere,",CD

4427,"indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars",CD

4428,"were fastened two great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing",CD

4429,"out in the open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which",CD

4430,appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring,CD

4431,"smithy, or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these",CD

4432,"harmless objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had",CD

4433,"opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had",CD

4434,"closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.",CD

4435,"From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came the",CD

4436,"usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring in it,",CD

4437,"weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were",CD

4438,going up to Heaven.,CD

4439,"""Thank God,"" said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, ""that no one near and dear to",CD

4440,me is in this dreadful town tonight. May He have mercy on all who are in,CD

4441,"danger!""",CD

4442,"Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought, ""They",CD

4443,"have come back!"" and sat listening. But, there was no loud irruption into the",CD

4444,"courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate clash again, and all was",CD

4445,quiet.,CD

4446,The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness,CD

4447,"respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally awaken, with such",CD

4448,"feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to go among the trusty",CD

4449,"people who were watching it, when his door suddenly opened, and two figures",CD

4450,"rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in amazement.",CD

4451,"Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that",CD

4452,"old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as",CD

4453,though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to,CD

4454,it in this one passage of her life.,CD

4455,"""What is this?"" cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. ""What is the matter?",CD

4456,"Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here? What is it?""",CD

4457,"With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in",CD

4458,"his arms, imploringly, ""O my dear friend! My husband!""",CD

4459,"""Your husband, Lucie?""",CD

4460,"""Charles.""",CD

4461,"""What of Charles?""",CD

4462,"""Here.",CD

4463,"""Here, in Paris?""",CD

4464,"""Has been here some daysthree or fourI don't know how manyI can't collect",CD

4465,my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was,CD

4466,"stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.""",CD

4467,"The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the beg",CD

4468,"of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring",CD

4469,into the courtyard.,CD

4470,"""What is that noise?"" said the Doctor, turning towards the window.",CD

4471,"""Don't look!"" cried Mr. Lorry. ""Don't look out! Manette, for your life, don't",CD

4472,"touch the blind!""",CD

4473,"The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and said,",CD

4474,"with a cool, bold smile:",CD

4478,"with embraces, or carry me in triumph. My old pain has given me a power that",CD

4479,"has brought us through the barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and",CD

4480,brought us here. I knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all,CD

4482,window.,CD

4483,"""Don't look!"" cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. ""No, Lucie, my dear, nor",CD

4484,"you!"" He got his arm round her, and held her. ""Don't be so terrified, my love. I",CD

4485,solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles;,CD

4486,that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place. What prison is he,CD

4487,"in?""",CD

4492,no help for you in any action on your part tonight; you cannot possibly stir out.,CD

4493,"I say this, because what I must bid you to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest",CD

4494,"thing to do of all. You must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let",CD

4495,me put you in a room at the back here. You must leave your father and me,CD

4501,"then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and partly",CD

4502,"opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor's arm, and looked out with",CD

4503,him into the courtyard.,CD

4504,"Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near",CD

4505,"enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The people in",CD

4506,"possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they had rushed in to",CD

4507,"work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose, as",CD

4508,in a convenient and retired spot.,CD

4509,"But, such awful workers, and such awful work!",CD

4510,"The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two men,",CD

4511,"whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the",CD

4512,"grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than the",CD

4513,visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise. False,CD

4514,"eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their hideous",CD

4515,"countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with howling, and all",CD

4516,staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep. As these,CD

4517,"ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung forward over their",CD

4518,"eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women held wine to their",CD

4519,"mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping blood, and what with",CD

4520,"dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone, all",CD

4521,their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire. The eye could not detect one,CD

4522,creature in the group free from the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to,CD

4523,"get next at the sharpeningstone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain",CD

4524,"all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain upon",CD

4525,those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace and silk and,CD

4526,"ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through. Hatchets,",CD

4527,"knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it.",CD

4528,"Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them,",CD

4529,"with strips of linen and fragments of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all",CD

4530,deep of the one colour. And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched,CD

4531,"them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red",CD

4532,hue was red in their frenzied eyes;eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would,CD

4533,"have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a welldirected gun.",CD

4534,"All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of any",CD

4535,"human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it were there. They",CD

4536,"drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for explanation in his",CD

4537,friend's ashy face.,CD

4538,"""They are,"" Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at the",CD

4539,"locked room, ""murdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you say; if you",CD

4542,"know, but let it not be a minute later!""",CD

4543,"Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room, and",CD

4544,was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.,CD

4545,"His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence",CD

4546,"of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant",CD

4547,to the heart of the concourse at the stone. For a few moments there was a,CD

4548,"pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and the unintelligible sound of his voice;",CD

4549,"and then Mr. Lorry saw him, surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of",CD

4550,"twenty men long, all linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried",CD

4551,"out with cries of""Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner's",CD

4552,kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save the,CD

4553,"prisoner Evremonde at La Force!"" and a thousand answering shouts.",CD

4554,"He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window and the",CD

4555,"curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was assisted by the",CD

4556,"people, and gone in search of her husband. He found her child and Miss Pross",CD

4557,"with her; but, it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until",CD

4558,"a long time afterwards, when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night",CD

4559,knew.,CD

4560,"Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet, clinging to",CD

4561,"his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own bed, and her head had",CD

4562,"gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge. O the long, long night,",CD

4563,"with the moans of the poor wife! And O the long, long night, with no return of",CD

4564,her father and no tidings!,CD

4565,"Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the irruption",CD

4566,"was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered. ""What is it?"" cried",CD

4567,"Lucie, affrighted. ""Hush! The soldiers' swords are sharpened there,"" said Mr.",CD

4568,"Lorry. ""The place is national property now, and used as a kind of armoury, my",CD

4569,"love.""",CD

4570,"Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful. Soon",CD

4571,"afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself from the",CD

4572,"clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so besmeared that he",CD

4573,might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a,CD

4574,"field of slain, was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone, and",CD

4575,"looking about him with a vacant air. Shortly, this wornout murderer descried in",CD

4576,"the imperfect light one of the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that",CD

4577,"gorgeous vehicle, climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest",CD

4578,on its dainty cushions.,CD

4579,"The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again, and",CD

4580,"the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood alone there",CD

4581,"in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never given, and",CD

4582,would never take away.,CD

4583,III.,CD

4584,The Shadow,CD

4585,One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr. Lorry,CD

4586,"when business hours came round, was this:that he had no right to imperil",CD

4587,Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof.,CD

4588,"His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded for Lucie and her",CD

4589,"child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust he held was not his own,",CD

4590,and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business.,CD

4591,"At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out the",CD

4592,wineshop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest,CD

4593,"dwellingplace in the distracted state of the city. But, the same consideration",CD

4594,"that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the most violent Quarter, and",CD

4595,"doubtless was influential there, and deep in its dangerous workings.",CD

4596,"Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay tending",CD

4597,"to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said that her",CD

4598,"father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that Quarter, near the",CD

4599,"Bankinghouse. As there was no business objection to this, and as he foresaw",CD

4600,"that even if it were all well with Charles, and he were to be released, he could",CD

4602,"found a suitable one, high up in a removed bystreet where the closed blinds in",CD

4603,all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked,CD

4604,deserted homes.,CD

4605,"To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:",CD

4606,"giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself. He",CD

4607,"left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable",CD

4608,"knocking on the head, and retained to his own occupations. A disturbed and",CD

4609,"doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly and heavily the day",CD

4610,lagged on with him.,CD

4611,"It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He was",CD

4612,"again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to do next,",CD

4613,"when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a man stood in his",CD

4614,"presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him, addressed him by his",CD

4615,name.,CD

4616,"""Your servant,"" said Mr. Lorry. ""Do you know me?""",CD

4617,"He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from fortyfive to fifty",CD

4618,"years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of emphasis, the",CD

4619,words:,CD

4620,"""Do you know me?""",CD

4621,"""I have seen you somewhere.""",CD

4622,"""Perhaps at my wineshop?""",CD

4623,"Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: ""You come from Doctor",CD

4625,"""Yes. I come from Doctor Manette.""",CD

4626,"""And what says he? What does he send me?""",CD

4627,"Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the words",CD

4628,in the Doctor's writing:,CD

4629,"""Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.",CD

4630,I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note,CD

4631,"from Charles to his wife. Let the bearer see his wife.""",CD

4632,"It was dated from La Force, within an hour.",CD

4633,"""Will you accompany me,"" said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading this",CD

4634,"note aloud, ""to where his wife resides?""",CD

4635,"""Yes,"" returned Defarge.",CD

4636,"Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way",CD

4637,"Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the",CD

4638,"courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.",CD

4639,"""Madame Defarge, surely!"" said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly the",CD

4640,same attitude some seventeen years ago.,CD

4641,"""It is she,"" observed her husband.",CD

4642,"""Does Madame go with us?"" inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as they",CD

4643,moved.,CD

4644,"""Yes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons. It is",CD

4645,"for their safety.""",CD

4646,"Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously at",CD

4647,"him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being The",CD

4648,Vengeance.,CD

4649,"They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might, ascended",CD

4650,"the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry, and found Lucie",CD

4651,"weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the tidings Mr. Lorry gave",CD

4652,"her of her husband, and clasped the hand that delivered his notelittle thinking",CD

4653,"what it had been doing near him in the night, and might, but for a chance, have",CD

4654,done to him.,CD

4659,"she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the hands that knitted.",CD

4660,"It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly action, but the hand made no",CD

4661,"responsedropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again.",CD

4662,There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in the,CD

4663,"act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck,",CD

4664,looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows,CD

4665,"and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.",CD

4666,"""My dear,"" said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; ""there are frequent risings in",CD

4667,"the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame",CD

4668,"Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times,",CD

4669,"to the end that she may know themthat she may identify them. I believe,"" said",CD

4670,"Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the",CD

4671,"three impressed itself upon him more and more, ""I state the case, Citizen",CD

4672,"Defarge?""",CD

4673,"Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a gruff",CD

4674,sound of acquiescence.,CD

4676,"tone and manner, ""have the dear child here, and our good Pross. Our good",CD

4678,"The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match",CD

4681,"encountered, ""Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope you are pretty well!"" She also",CD

4682,"bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took",CD

4683,much heed of her.,CD

4689,The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so,CD

4690,"threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the",CD

4692,"Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on",CD

4693,both the mother and the child.,CD

4694,"""It is enough, my husband,"" said Madame Defarge. ""I have seen them. We",CD

4701,"""Your husband is not my business here,"" returned Madame Defarge, looking",CD

4702,"down at her with perfect composure. ""It is the daughter of your father who is",CD

4703,"my business here.""",CD

4704,"""For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She will",CD

4707,"Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.",CD

4708,"Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumbnail and looking at her,",CD

4709,collected his face into a sterner expression.,CD

4744,IV.,CD

4745,Calm in Storm,CD

4746,Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his,CD

4747,absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept,CD

4748,"from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that not until",CD

4749,"long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she know that eleven",CD

4750,hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by,CD

4751,the populace; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of,CD

4752,horror; and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain. She only,CD

4753,"knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners",CD

4754,"had been in danger, and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and",CD

4755,murdered.,CD

4756,"To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on",CD

4757,"which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a scene",CD

4758,"of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had found a",CD

4759,"selfappointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were brought singly,",CD

4760,"and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred, or to",CD

4761,"be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back to their cells. That, presented",CD

4762,"by his conductors to this Tribunal, he had announced himself by name and",CD

4763,profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner,CD

4764,"in the Bastille; that, one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and",CD

4765,"identified him, and that this man was Defarge.",CD

4766,"That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table, that his",CD

4767,"soninlaw was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard to the",CD

4768,"Tribunalof whom some members were asleep and some awake, some dirty",CD

4769,"with murder and some clean, some sober and some notfor his life and liberty.",CD

4770,"That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer",CD

4771,"under the overthrown system, it had been accorded to him to have Charles",CD

4772,"Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and examined. That, he seemed on",CD

4773,"the point of being at once released, when the tide in his favour met with some",CD

4774,"unexplained check (not intelligible to the Doctor), which led to a few words of",CD

4775,"secret conference. That, the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor",CD

4776,"Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be",CD

4777,"held inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner was",CD

4778,"removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the Doctor, had then",CD

4779,so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his,CD

4780,"soninlaw was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to the concourse",CD

4781,"whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings,",CD

4782,"that he had obtained the permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood",CD

4783,until the danger was over.,CD

4784,"The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by",CD

4785,"intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved,",CD

4786,had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were,CD

4787,"cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had been discharged into",CD

4788,"the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed",CD

4789,"out. Being besought to go to him and dress the wound, the Doctor had passed",CD

4790,"out at the same gate, and had found him in the arms of a company of",CD

4791,"Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies of their victims. With an",CD

4792,"inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare, they had",CD

4793,"helped the healer, and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitudehad",CD

4794,made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spothad then caught,CD

4795,"up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the",CD

4796,"Doctor had covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of",CD

4797,it.,CD

4798,"As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of his",CD

4799,"friend now sixtytwo years of age, a misgiving arose within him that such dread",CD

4800,experiences would revive the old danger.,CD

4801,"But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never at all",CD

4802,"known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor felt, now, that",CD

4803,his suffering was strength and power. For the first time he felt that in that,CD

4804,"sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of",CD

4805,"his daughter's husband, and deliver him. ""It all tended to a good end, my",CD

4806,friend; it was not mere waste and ruin. As my beloved child was helpful in,CD

4807,"restoring me to myself, I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of",CD

4808,"herself to her; by the aid of Heaven I will do it!"" Thus, Doctor Manette. And",CD

4809,"when Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look",CD

4810,and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been,CD

4811,"stopped, like a clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an",CD

4812,"energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he",CD

4813,believed.,CD

4814,"Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would have",CD

4815,"yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself in his place, as",CD

4816,"a physician, whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond and free,",CD

4817,"rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he",CD

4818,"was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons, and among them of La",CD

4819,Force. He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined,CD

4820,"alone, but was mixed with the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband",CD

4821,"weekly, and brought sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes",CD

4822,"her husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand),",CD

4823,"but she was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild",CD

4824,"suspicions of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who",CD

4825,were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.,CD

4826,"This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the sagacious",CD

4827,Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it. Nothing unbecoming,CD

4828,tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he observed it as a,CD

4829,"curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been",CD

4830,"associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend, with his personal",CD

4831,"affliction, deprivation, and weakness. Now that this was changed, and he knew",CD

4832,himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both,CD

4833,"looked for Charles's ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted",CD

4834,"by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the",CD

4835,"weak, to trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself",CD

4836,"and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could",CD

4837,"reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to",CD

4838,"her who had rendered so much to him. ""All curious to see,"" thought Mr. Lorry,",CD

4839,"in his amiably shrewd way, ""but all natural and right; so, take the lead, my",CD

4840,"dear friend, and keep it; it couldn't be in better hands.""",CD

4841,"But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles",CD

4842,"Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the public current",CD

4843,of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new era began; the king was,CD

4844,"tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or",CD

4845,"Death, declared for victory or death against the world in arms; the black flag",CD

4846,waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred,CD

4847,"thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all",CD

4848,"the varying soils of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast,",CD

4849,"and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial",CD

4850,"mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in",CD

4851,"fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olivegrounds and among the cropped",CD

4852,"grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers,",CD

4853,and in the sand of the seashore. What private solicitude could rear itself,CD

4854,"against the deluge of the Year One of Libertythe deluge rising from below, not",CD

4855,"falling from above, and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!",CD

4856,"There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no",CD

4857,measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when,CD

4858,"time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count",CD

4859,"of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation, as it",CD

4860,"is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole",CD

4861,"city, the executioner showed the people the head of the kingand now, it",CD

4862,"seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had",CD

4863,"eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.",CD

4864,"And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such",CD

4865,"cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A revolutionary tribunal in",CD

4866,"the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the",CD

4867,"land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life,",CD

4868,and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one;,CD

4869,"prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain",CD

4870,no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed,CD

4871,"things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.",CD

4872,"Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the",CD

4873,general gaze from the foundations of the worldthe figure of the sharp female,CD

4874,called La Guillotine.,CD

4875,"It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache, it",CD

4876,"infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar delicacy",CD

4877,"to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved close: who kissed",CD

4878,"La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack. It",CD

4879,was the sign of the regeneration of the human race. It superseded the Cross.,CD

4880,"Models of it were worn on breasts from which the Cross was discarded, and it",CD

4881,was bowed down to and believed in where the Cross was denied.,CD

4882,"It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted, were a",CD

4883,"rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toypuzzle for a young Devil, and was",CD

4884,"put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed the eloquent, struck",CD

4885,"down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and good. Twentytwo friends of",CD

4886,"high public mark, twentyone living and one dead, it had lopped the heads off,",CD

4887,"in one morning, in as many minutes. The name of the strong man of Old",CD

4888,"Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed,",CD

4889,"he was stronger than his namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of",CD

4890,God's own Temple every day.,CD

4891,"Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked with",CD

5022,"could not be fewer than five hundred people, and they were dancing like five",CD

5038,"and their hands high up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been",CD

5192,"counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of",CD

5193,his road.,CD

5194,"The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not",CD

5195,sooner?,CD

5196,"He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means of",CD

5197,"living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England, he lived by",CD

5198,giving instruction in the French language and literature. He had returned when,CD

5199,"he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen, who",CD

5200,"represented that his life was endangered by his absence. He had come back, to",CD

5201,"save a citizen's life, and to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to",CD

5202,the truth. Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic?,CD

5203,"The populace cried enthusiastically, ""No!"" and the President rang his bell to",CD

5204,"quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry ""No!"" until they left off,",CD

5205,of their own will.,CD

5206,The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained that the,CD

5207,citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence to the citizen's,CD

5208,"letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier, but which he did not",CD

5209,doubt would be found among the papers then before the President.,CD

5210,The Doctor had taken care that it should be therehad assured him that it would,CD

5211,be thereand at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read. Citizen,CD

5212,"Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen Gabelle hinted, with",CD

5213,"infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the pressure of business imposed on the",CD

5214,Tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had to,CD

5215,"deal, he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the Abbayein fact, had",CD

5216,rather passed out of the Tribunal's patriotic remembranceuntil three days ago;,CD

5217,"when he had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the",CD

5218,Jury's declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was,CD

5219,"answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde, called",CD

5220,Darnay.,CD

5221,"Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity, and the",CD

5222,"clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he",CD

5223,showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long,CD

5224,"imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England, always faithful and",CD

5225,"devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile; that, so far from being in",CD

5226,"favour with the Aristocrat government there, he had actually been tried for his",CD

5227,"life by it, as the foe of England and friend of the United Statesas he brought",CD

5228,"these circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the",CD

5229,"straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the populace",CD

5230,"became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English",CD

5231,"gentleman then and there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on",CD

5232,"that English trial and could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that",CD

5233,"they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the",CD

5234,President were content to receive them.,CD

5235,"At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace set up",CD

5236,"a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner's favour, and the",CD

5237,President declared him free.,CD

5238,"Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace",CD

5239,"sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards",CD

5240,"generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some setoff against their",CD

5241,swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of these,CD

5242,"motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable, to a blending",CD

5243,"of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner was the acquittal",CD

5244,"pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such",CD

5245,fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes,CD

5246,"as could rush at him, that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was",CD

5247,in danger of fainting from exhaustion; none the less because he knew very,CD

5248,"well, that the very same people, carried by another current, would have rushed",CD

5249,"at him with the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over",CD

5250,the streets.,CD

5251,"His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,",CD

5252,rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried,CD

5253,"together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not assisted",CD

5254,it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the,CD

5255,"nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to him before he left the",CD

5256,"place, condemned to die within twentyfour hours. The first of them told him",CD

5257,"so, with the customary prison sign of Deatha raised fingerand they all added in",CD

5258,"words, ""Long live the Republic!""",CD

5259,"The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings, for",CD

5260,"when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great crowd",CD

5261,"about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in Courtexcept",CD

5262,"two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the concourse made at",CD

5263,"him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by turns and all together,",CD

5264,"until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted,",CD

5265,"seemed to run mad, like the people on the shore.",CD

5266,"They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had",CD

5267,"taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages. Over the",CD

5268,"chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike",CD

5269,"with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not even the Doctor's",CD

5270,"entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men's shoulders, with",CD

5271,"a confused sea of red caps heaving about him, and casting up to sight from the",CD

5272,"stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that he more than once misdoubted his",CD

5273,"mind being in confusion, and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the",CD

5274,Guillotine.,CD

5275,"In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him",CD

5276,"out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing",CD

5277,"Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as they had",CD

5278,"reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into",CD

5279,"the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father had gone on before, to",CD

5280,"prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his feet, she dropped insensible",CD

5281,in his arms.,CD

5282,As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and,CD

5283,"the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen,",CD

5284,"a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the rest fell to dancing, and",CD

5285,"the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole. Then, they elevated into the",CD

5286,vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of,CD

5287,"Liberty, and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and",CD

5288,"along the river's bank, and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them",CD

5289,every one and whirled them away.,CD

5290,"After grasping the Doctor's hand, as he stood victorious and proud before him;",CD

5291,"after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in breathless from his",CD

5292,"struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole; after kissing little Lucie,",CD

5293,who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck; and after embracing the,CD

5294,"ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted her; he took his wife in his arms,",CD

5295,and carried her up to their rooms.,CD

5296,"""Lucie! My own! I am safe.""",CD

5297,"""O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to",CD

5298,"Him.""",CD

5299,They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again in his,CD

5300,"arms, he said to her:",CD

5301,"""And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France could",CD

5302,"have done what he has done for me.""",CD

5303,"She laid her head upon her father's breast, as she had laid his poor head on her",CD

5304,"own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return he had made her, he",CD

5305,"was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his strength. ""You must",CD

5306,"not be weak, my darling,"" he remonstrated; ""don't tremble so. I have saved",CD

5307,"him.""",CD

5308,VII.,CD

5309,A Knock at the Door,CD

5310,"""I have saved him."" It was not another of the dreams in which he had often",CD

5311,"come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a vague but",CD

5312,heavy fear was upon her.,CD

5313,"All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately",CD

5314,"revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague",CD

5315,"suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as",CD

5316,"blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day",CD

5317,"shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her heart could not be as",CD

5318,lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be. The shadows of the wintry,CD

5319,"afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now the dreadful carts were rolling",CD

5320,"through the streets. Her mind pursued them, looking for him among the",CD

5321,Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more.,CD

5322,"Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this woman's",CD

5323,"weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking, no One",CD

5324,"Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task he had",CD

5325,"set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let them all",CD

5326,lean upon him.,CD

5327,Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was the,CD

5328,"safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but because they",CD

5329,"were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment, had had to pay",CD

5330,"heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards the living of the",CD

5331,"poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and partly to avoid a domestic spy,",CD

5332,they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the,CD

5333,"courtyard gate, rendered them occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly",CD

5334,"transferred to them by Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his",CD

5335,bed there every night.,CD

5336,"It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty, Equality,",CD

5337,"Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every house, the name of",CD

5338,"every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size, at a certain",CD

5339,"convenient height from the ground. Mr. Jerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly",CD

5340,"embellished the doorpost down below; and, as the afternoon shadows",CD

5341,"deepened, the owner of that name himself appeared, from overlooking a",CD

5342,painter whom Doctor Manette had employed to add to the list the name of,CD

5343,"Charles Evremonde, called Darnay.",CD

5344,"In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual harmless",CD

5345,"ways of life were changed. In the Doctor's little household, as in very many",CD

5346,"others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased",CD

5347,"every evening, in small quantities and at various small shops. To avoid",CD

5348,"attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy,",CD

5349,was the general desire.,CD

5350,"For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the office",CD

5351,"of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the basket. Every",CD

5352,"afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted, they fared",CD

5353,"forth on this duty, and made and brought home such purchases as were",CD

5354,"needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long association with a French",CD

5355,"family, might have known as much of their language as of her own, if she had",CD

5356,"had a mind, she had no mind in that direction; consequently she knew no more",CD

5357,"of that ""nonsense"" (as she was pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her",CD

5358,manner of marketing was to plump a nounsubstantive at the head of a,CD

5359,"shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it",CD

5360,"happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that",CD

5361,"thing, lay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She",CD

5362,"always made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,",CD

5363,"one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.",CD

5364,"""Now, Mr. Cruncher,"" said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity; ""if",CD

5365,"you are ready, I am.""",CD

7160,"recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on",CD

7161,that old Sunday under the dear old planetree in the garden. If he had preserved,CD

7193,"end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking thoughts, which was",CD

7194,very difficult to master.,CD

7195,He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How high it,CD

7196,"was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be stood, how",CD

7197,"he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed red, which",CD

7198,"way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first, or might be the",CD

7199,"last: these and many similar questions, in nowise directed by his will, obtruded",CD

7200,"themselves over and over again, countless times. Neither were they connected",CD

7201,"with fear: he was conscious of no fear. Rather, they originated in a strange",CD

7202,besetting desire to know what to do when the time came; a desire gigantically,CD

7203,disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering,CD

7204,"that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.",CD

7205,"The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the numbers",CD

7206,"he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for ever, eleven gone",CD

7207,"for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard contest with that",CD

7208,"eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him, he had got the better",CD

7527,"a pretty sight!""",CD

7528,"""In a word,"" said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, ""I",CD

7529,"cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since last night, that",CD

7538,"The woodsawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission,",CD

7543,"""Ay, ay, why not!"" cried the sawyer. ""Every day, in all weathers, from two to",CD

7570,if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his,CD

7571,afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber. He was so,CD

7572,"very demonstrative herein, that he might have been suspected (perhaps was,",CD

7573,by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge's,CD

7594,"today.""",CD

7595,"""I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,"" said The Vengeance with alacrity,",CD

7597,"""I shall be there before the commencement.""",CD

7598,"""And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,"" said The",CD

7599,"Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the street, ""before",CD

7600,"the tumbrils arrive!""",CD

7601,"Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and might",CD

7602,"be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the mud, and round",CD

7603,"the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the Juryman, looking after",CD

7604,"her as she walked away, were highly appreciative of her fine figure, and her",CD

7605,superb moral endowments.,CD

7606,"There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully",CD

7607,"disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than",CD

7608,"this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a strong and",CD

7609,"fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of",CD

7610,that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness,CD

7611,"and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those",CD

7612,"qualities; the troubled time would have heaved her up, under any",CD

7613,"circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of",CD

7614,"wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into",CD

7615,"a tigress. She was absolutely without pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her,",CD

7616,it had quite gone out of her.,CD

7617,"It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his",CD

7618,"forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that his wife was",CD

7619,to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient,CD

7620,"punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such",CD

7621,"had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no",CD

7622,"sense of pity, even for herself. If she had been laid low in the streets, in any of",CD

7623,"the many encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not have",CD

7624,"pitied herself; nor, if she had been ordered to the axe tomorrow, would she",CD

7625,have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places,CD

7626,with the man who sent her there.,CD

7627,"Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly worn,",CD

7628,"it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair",CD

7629,"looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her bosom, was a loaded",CD

7630,"pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened dagger. Thus accoutred, and",CD

7631,"walking with the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple",CD

7632,"freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, barefoot and",CD

7633,"barelegged, on the brown seasand, Madame Defarge took her way along the",CD

7634,streets.,CD

7635,"Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting",CD

7636,"for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night, the difficulty of",CD

7637,taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's attention. It was not,CD

7638,"merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach, but it was of the highest",CD

7639,"importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers, should",CD

7640,be reduced to the utmost; since their escape might depend on the saving of,CD

7641,"only a few seconds here and there. Finally, he had proposed, after anxious",CD

7642,"consideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city,",CD

7643,should leave it at three o'clock in the lightestwheeled conveyance known to,CD

7644,"that period. Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach,",CD

7645,"and, passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance,",CD

7646,"and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when",CD

7647,delay was the most to be dreaded.,CD

7648,Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing,CD

7649,"emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had beheld the coach",CD

7650,"start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten",CD

7651,"minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements",CD

7652,"to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge, taking her way through the",CD

7653,"streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the elsedeserted lodging in which they",CD

7654,held their consultation.,CD

7655,"""Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,"" said Miss Pross, whose agitation was",CD

7656,"so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live: ""what do you",CD

7657,think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another carriage having already,CD

7658,"gone from here today, it might awaken suspicion.""",CD

7659,"""My opinion, miss,"" returned Mr. Cruncher, ""is as you're right. Likewise wot",CD

7660,"I'll stand by you, right or wrong.""",CD

7661,"""I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,"" said Miss",CD

7662,"Pross, wildly crying, ""that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are you",CD

7663,"capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?""",CD

7664,"""Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss,"" returned Mr. Cruncher, ""I hope so.",CD

7665,"Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o' mine, I think not.",CD

7666,"Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o' two promises and wows",CD

7667,"wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?""",CD

7668,"""Oh, for gracious sake!"" cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, ""record them at",CD

7669,"once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.""",CD

7670,"""First,"" said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with an",CD

7671,"ashy and solemn visage, ""them poor things well out o' this, never no more will",CD

7672,"I do it, never no more!""",CD

7673,"""I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,"" returned Miss Pross, ""that you never will do it",CD

7674,"again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it necessary to mention more",CD

7675,"particularly what it is.""",CD

7676,"""No, miss,"" returned Jerry, ""it shall not be named to you. Second: them poor",CD

7677,"things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher's",CD

7678,"flopping, never no more!""",CD

7679,"""Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,"" said Miss Pross, striving",CD

7680,"to dry her eyes and compose herself, ""I have no doubt it is best that Mrs.",CD

7681,Cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence.O my poor,CD

7682,"darlings!""",CD

7683,"""I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,"" proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a most",CD

7684,"alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit""and let my words be took",CD

7685,down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourselfthat wot my opinions,CD

7686,"respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only hope with all",CD

7687,"my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time.""",CD

7688,"""There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,"" cried the distracted Miss",CD

7689,"Pross, ""and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.""",CD

7690,"""Forbid it,"" proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additional",CD

7691,"slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out, ""as anything wot",CD

7692,I have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor,CD

7693,creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn't all flop (if it was anyways conwenient),CD

7694,"to get 'em out o' this here dismal risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, forbid it!""",CD

7695,This was Mr. Cruncher's conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to,CD

7696,find a better one.,CD

7697,"And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer",CD

7698,and nearer.,CD

7699,"""If we ever get back to our native land,"" said Miss Pross, ""you may rely upon",CD

7700,my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and,CD

7701,understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events you may,CD

7702,be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this,CD

7703,"dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us",CD

7704,"think!""",CD

7705,"Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and",CD

7706,nearer.,CD

7707,"""If you were to go before,"" said Miss Pross, ""and stop the vehicle and horses",CD

7708,"from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn't that be",CD

7709,"best?""",CD

7710,Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.,CD

7711,"""Where could you wait for me?"" asked Miss Pross.",CD

7712,Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but Temple,CD

7713,"Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge was",CD

7714,drawing very near indeed.,CD

7715,"""By the cathedral door,"" said Miss Pross. ""Would it be much out of the way, to",CD

7716,"take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?""",CD

7717,"""No, miss,"" answered Mr. Cruncher.",CD

7718,"""Then, like the best of men,"" said Miss Pross, ""go to the postinghouse straight,",CD

7719,"and make that change.""",CD

7720,"""I am doubtful,"" said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head, ""about",CD

7721,"leaving of you, you see. We don't know what may happen.""",CD

7722,"""Heaven knows we don't,"" returned Miss Pross, ""but have no fear for me. Take",CD

7724,"it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain of it. There! Bless you,",CD

7726,"us!""",CD

7727,"This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping",CD

7728,"his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he immediately",CD

7729,"went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she had",CD

7730,proposed.,CD

7731,"The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution,",CD

7732,was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing her appearance so,CD

7733,"that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief. She",CD

7734,"looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two. She had no time to",CD

7735,"lose, but must get ready at once.",CD

7736,"Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted rooms,",CD

7737,"and of halfimagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them, Miss",CD

7738,"Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes, which were swollen",CD

7739,"and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she could not bear to have her",CD

7740,"sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water, but constantly",CD

7741,paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her. In one of,CD

7742,"those pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the",CD

7743,room.,CD

7744,"The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of",CD

7745,"Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,",CD

7746,those feet had come to meet that water.,CD

7747,"Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, ""The wife of Evremonde;",CD

7748,"where is she?""",CD

7749,"It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open, and",CD

7750,would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were four in the,CD

7751,"room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before the door of the",CD

7752,chamber which Lucie had occupied.,CD

7753,"Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and",CD

7754,rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her;,CD

7755,"years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her appearance;",CD

7756,"but, she too was a determined woman in her different way, and she measured",CD

7757,"Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.",CD

7758,"""You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,"" said Miss Pross, in",CD

7759,"her breathing. ""Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of me. I am an",CD

7760,"Englishwoman.""",CD

7761,"Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of Miss",CD

7762,"Pross's own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight, hard, wiry",CD

7763,"woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a",CD

7764,"strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that Miss Pross was the",CD

7765,family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was,CD

7766,the family's malevolent enemy.,CD

7767,"""On my way yonder,"" said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her",CD

7768,"hand towards the fatal spot, ""where they reserve my chair and my knitting for",CD

7771,"upon it, I'll hold my own against them.""",CD

7772,Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words; both,CD

7773,"were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what the",CD

7774,unintelligible words meant.,CD

7775,"""It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment,""",CD

7780,"foreign woman; I am your match.""",CD

7781,Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail;,CD

7783,"""Woman imbecile and piglike!"" said Madame Defarge, frowning. ""I take no",CD

7784,"answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand to see her,",CD

7785,"or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!"" This, with an angry",CD

7786,explanatory wave of her right arm.,CD

7787,"""I little thought,"" said Miss Pross, ""that I should ever want to understand your",CD

7827,Miss Pross.,CD

7828,"Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the moment,",CD

7829,"seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight. It was in vain",CD

7831,"tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her tight, and",CD

7832,even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had. The two hands of,CD

7833,"Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face; but, Miss Pross, with her head",CD

7834,"down, held her round the waist, and clung to her with more than the hold of a",CD

7835,drowning woman.,CD

7836,"Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled",CD

7843,"All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful stillness, it",CD

7845,lifeless on the ground.,CD

7846,"In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the body as far",CD

7848,"she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did, in time to check",CD

7849,"herself and go back. It was dreadful to go in at the door again; but, she did go",CD

7850,"in, and even went near it, to get the bonnet and other things that she must",CD

7851,"wear. These she put on, out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door",CD

7852,and taking away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to,CD

7854,"By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have gone",CD

7855,"along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she was",CD

7856,naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other,CD

7857,"woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of gripping fingers were",CD

7858,"deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her dress (hastily composed with",CD

7863,"the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at",CD

7872,"she'll see that."" And she did.",CD

8087,Young.�,OH

8088,The �Dillingham� had been flung to the breeze during a former period of,OH

8089,"prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the",OH

8090,"income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting",OH

8091,to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young,OH

8092,came home and reached his flat above he was called �Jim� and greatly hugged,OH

8093,"by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which",OH

8094,is all very good.,OH

8095,Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She,OH

8096,stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in,OH

8097,"a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87",OH

8098,with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could,OH

8099,"for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn�t go far. Expenses",OH

8100,had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy,OH

8101,a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for,OH

8102,something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling�something just,OH

8103,a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.,OH

8104,There was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you,OH

8105,"have seen a pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by",OH

8106,"observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a",OH

8107,"fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the",OH

8108,art.,OH

8109,Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her,OH

8110,"eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty",OH

8111,seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.,OH

8112,"Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in",OH

8113,which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim�s gold watch that had been,OH

8114,his father�s and his grandfather�s. The other was Della�s hair. Had the queen of,OH

8115,"Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang",OH

8116,out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty�s jewels and,OH

8117,"gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the",OH

8118,"basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to",OH

8119,see him pluck at his beard from envy.,OH

8120,So now Della�s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a,OH

8121,cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a,OH

8122,garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she,OH

8123,faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn,OH

8124,red carpet.,OH

8125,On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of,OH

8126,"skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door",OH

8127,and down the stairs to the street.,OH

8128,Where she stopped the sign read: �Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All,OH

8129,"Kinds.� One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large,",OH

8130,"too white, chilly, hardly looked the �Sofronie.�",OH

8131,�Will you buy my hair?� asked Della.,OH

8132,"�I buy hair,� said Madame. �Take yer hat off and let�s have a sight at the",OH

8133,looks of it.�,OH

8134,Down rippled the brown cascade.,OH

8135,"�Twenty dollars,� said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.",OH

8136,"�Give it to me quick,� said Della.",OH

8137,"Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed",OH

8138,metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim�s present.,OH

8139,She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There,OH

8140,"was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside",OH

8141,"out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly",OH

8142,proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious,OH

8143,ornamentation�as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The,OH

8144,Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim�s. It was like him.,OH

8145,Quietness and value�the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they,OH

8146,"took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain",OH

8147,on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company.,OH

8148,"Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the",OH

8149,old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.,OH

8150,When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence,OH

8151,and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work,OH

8152,repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a,OH

8153,"tremendous task, dear friends�a mammoth task.",OH

8154,"Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that",OH

8155,made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her,OH

8156,"reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.",OH

8157,"�If Jim doesn�t kill me,� she said to herself, �before he takes a second look",OH

8158,"at me, he�ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do�",OH

8159,oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?�,OH

8160,At 7 o�clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of,OH

8161,the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.,OH

8162,Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the,OH

8163,corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his,OH

8164,"step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a",OH

8165,moment. She had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest,OH

8166,"everyday things, and now she whispered: �Please God, make him think I am",OH

8167,still pretty.�,OH

8168,The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very,OH

8169,"serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two�and to be burdened with a",OH

8170,family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.,OH

8171,"Jim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail.",OH

8172,"His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she",OH

8173,"could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor",OH

8174,"disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared",OH

8175,for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.,OH

8176,Della wriggled off the table and went for him.,OH

8177,"�Jim, darling,� she cried, �don�t look at me that way. I had my hair cut off",OH

8178,and sold because I couldn�t have lived through Christmas without giving you a,OH

8179,"present. It�ll grow out again�you won�t mind, will you? I just had to do it.",OH

8180,"My hair grows awfully fast. Say �Merry Christmas!� Jim, and let�s be happy.",OH

8181,"You don�t know what a nice�what a beautiful, nice gift I�ve got for you.�",OH

8182,"�You�ve cut off your hair?� asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived",OH

8183,at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.,OH

8184,"�Cut it off and sold it,� said Della. �Don�t you like me just as well,",OH

8185,"anyhow? I�m me without my hair, ain�t I?�",OH

8186,Jim looked about the room curiously.,OH

8187,"�You say your hair is gone?� he said, with an air almost of idiocy.",OH

8188,"�You needn�t look for it,� said Della. �It�s sold, I tell you�sold and gone,",OH

8189,"too. It�s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the",OH

8190,"hairs of my head were numbered,� she went on with sudden serious sweetness,",OH

8191,"�but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?�",OH

8192,Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For,OH

8193,ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in,OH

8194,the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year�what is the,OH

8195,difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The,OH

8196,"magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion",OH

8197,will be illuminated later on.,OH

8198,Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.,OH

8199,"�Don�t make any mistake, Dell,� he said, �about me. I don�t think there�s",OH

8200,anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me,OH

8201,like my girl any less. But if you�ll unwrap that package you may see why you,OH

8202,had me going a while at first.�,OH

8203,White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic,OH

8204,"scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and",OH

8205,"wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers",OH

8206,of the lord of the flat.,OH

8207,"For there lay The Combs�the set of combs, side and back, that Della had",OH

8208,"worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell,",OH

8209,with jewelled rims�just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They,OH

8210,"were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and",OH

8211,"yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were",OH

8212,"hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were",OH

8213,gone.,OH

8214,"But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up",OH

8215,"with dim eyes and a smile and say: �My hair grows so fast, Jim!�",OH

8216,"And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, �Oh, oh!�",OH

8217,Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly,OH

8218,upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection,OH

8219,of her bright and ardent spirit.,OH

8220,"�Isn�t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You�ll have to look",OH

8221,at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how,OH

8222,it looks on it.�,OH

8223,"Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands",OH

8224,under the back of his head and smiled.,OH

8225,"�Dell,� said he, �let�s put our Christmas presents away and keep �em a",OH

8226,while. They�re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money,OH

8227,to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.�,OH

8228,"The magi, as you know, were wise men�wonderfully wise men�who",OH

8229,brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving,OH

8230,"Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly",OH

8231,bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have,OH

8232,lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat,OH

8233,who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their,OH

8234,house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who,OH

8235,"give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as",OH

8241,anything he usually--but this is not Baldy's story. He poured out a third drink,OH

8242,that was larger by a finger than the first and second. Baldy was in,OH

8243,consultation; and the consultee is worthy of his hire.,OH

8244,"""I'd be king if I was you,"" said Baldy, so positively that his holster creaked and",OH

8245,his spurs rattled.,OH

8246,"Webb Yeager pushed back his flat-brimmed Stetson, and made further disorder",OH

8247,"in his straw-coloured hair. The tonsorial recourse being without avail, he",OH

8248,followed the liquid example of the more resourceful Baldy.,OH

8249,"""If a man marries a queen, it oughtn't to make him a two-spot,"" declared",OH

8250,"Webb, epitomising his grievances.",OH

8251,"""Sure not,"" said Baldy, sympathetic, still thirsty, and genuinely solicitous",OH

8252,"concerning the relative value of the cards. ""By rights you're a king. If I was",OH

8253,"you, I'd call for a new deal. The cards have been stacked on you--I'll tell you",OH

8254,"what you are, Webb Yeager.""",OH

8255,"""What?"" asked Webb, with a hopeful look in his pale-blue eyes.",OH

8256,"""You're a prince-consort.""",OH

8257,"""Go easy,"" said Webb. ""I never blackguarded you none.""",OH

8258,"""It's a title,"" explained Baldy, ""up among the picture-cards; but it don't take no",OH

8259,"tricks. I'll tell you, Webb. It's a brand they're got for certain animals in Europe.",OH

8260,Say that you or me or one of them Dutch dukes marries in a royal family.,OH

8261,"Well, by and by our wife gets to be queen. Are we king? Not in a million",OH

8262,years. At the coronation ceremonies we march between little casino and the,OH

8263,Ninth Grand Custodian of the Royal Hall Bedchamber. The only use we are is,OH

8264,"to appear in photographs, and accept the responsibility for the heir- apparent.",OH

8265,"That ain't any square deal. Yes, sir, Webb, you're a prince- consort; and if I was",OH

8266,"you, I'd start a interregnum or a habeus corpus or somethin'; and I'd be king if",OH

8267,"I had to turn from the bottom of the deck.""",OH

8268,Baldy emptied his glass to the ratification of his Warwick pose.,OH

8269,"""Baldy,"" said Webb, solemnly, ""me and you punched cows in the same outfit",OH

8270,"for years. We been runnin' on the same range, and ridin' the same trails since",OH

8271,we was boys. I wouldn't talk about my family affairs to nobody but you. You,OH

8272,was line-rider on the Nopalito Ranch when I married Santa McAllister. I was,OH

8273,"foreman then; but what am I now? I don't amount to a knot in a stake rope.""",OH

8274,"""When old McAllister was the cattle king of West Texas,"" continued Baldy",OH

8275,"with Satanic sweetness, ""you was some tallow. You had as much to say on the",OH

8276,"ranch as he did.""",OH

8277,"""I did,"" admitted Webb, ""up to the time he found out I was tryin' to get my",OH

8278,rope over Santa's head. Then he kept me out on the range as far from the,OH

8279,ranch-house as he could. When the old man died they commenced to call,OH

8280,Santa the 'cattle queen.' I'm boss of the cattle--that's all. She 'tends to all the,OH

8281,business; she handles all the money; I can't sell even a beef-steer to a party of,OH

8282,"campers, myself. Santa's the 'queen'; and I'm Mr. Nobody.""",OH

8283,"""I'd be king if I was you,"" repeated Baldy Woods, the royalist. ""When a man",OH

8284,marries a queen he ought to grade up with her--on the hoof-- dressed--dried-corned--any old way from the chaparral to the packing- house. Lots of folks,OH

8285,"thinks it's funny, Webb, that you don't have the say-so on the Nopalito. I ain't",OH

8286,reflectin' none on Miz Yeager--she's the finest little lady between the Rio,OH

8287,"Grande and next Christmas--but a man ought to be boss of his own camp.""",OH

8288,"The smooth, brown face of Yeager lengthened to a mask of wounded",OH

8289,"melancholy. With that expression, and his rumpled yellow hair and guileless",OH

8290,"blue eyes, he might have been likened to a schoolboy whose leadership had",OH

8291,been usurped by a youngster of superior strength. But his active and sinewy,OH

8292,"seventy-two inches, and his girded revolvers forbade the comparison.",OH

8293,"""What was that you called me, Baldy?"" he asked. ""What kind of a concert was",OH

8294,"it?""",OH

8295,"""A 'consort,'"" corrected Baldy--""a 'prince-consort.' It's a kind of short-card",OH

8296,"pseudonym. You come in sort of between Jack-high and a four-card flush.""",OH

8297,"Webb Yeager sighed, and gathered the strap of his Winchester scabbard from",OH

8298,the floor.,OH

8299,"""I'm ridin' back to the ranch to-day,"" he said half-heartedly. ""I've got to start a",OH

8300,"bunch of beeves for San Antone in the morning.""",OH

8301,"""I'm your company as far as Dry Lake,"" announced Baldy. ""I've got a round-up",OH

8302,"camp on the San Marcos cuttin' out two-year-olds.""",OH

8303,The two /companeros/ mounted their ponies and trotted away from the little,OH

8304,"railroad settlement, where they had foregathered in the thirsty morning.",OH

8305,"At Dry Lake, where their routes diverged, they reined up for a parting",OH

8306,cigarette. For miles they had ridden in silence save for the soft drum of the,OH

8307,"ponies' hoofs on the matted mesquite grass, and the rattle of the chaparral",OH

8308,against their wooden stirrups. But in Texas discourse is seldom continuous.,OH

8309,"You may fill in a mile, a meal, and a murder between your paragraphs without",OH

8310,"detriment to your thesis. So, without apology, Webb offered an addendum to",OH

8311,the conversation that had begun ten miles away.,OH

8312,"""You remember, yourself, Baldy, that there was a time when Santa wasn't quite",OH

8313,so independent. You remember the days when old McAllister was keepin' us,OH

8314,"apart, and how she used to send me the sign that she wanted to see me? Old",OH

8315,man Mac promised to make me look like a colander if I ever come in gun-shot,OH

8316,"of the ranch. You remember the sign she used to send, Baldy--the heart with a",OH

8317,"cross inside of it?""",OH

8318,"""Me?"" cried Baldy, with intoxicated archness. ""You old sugar-stealing coyote!",OH

8319,"Don't I remember! Why, you dad-blamed old long-horned turtle- dove, the",OH

8320,boys in camp was all cognoscious about them hiroglyphs. The 'gizzard-andcrossbones' we used to call it. We used to see 'em on truck that was sent out,OH

8321,from the ranch. They was marked in charcoal on the sacks of flour and in leadpencil on the newspapers. I see one of 'em once chalked on the back of a new,OH

8322,"cook that old man McAllister sent out from the ranch--danged if I didn't.""",OH

8323,"""Santa's father,"" explained Webb gently, ""got her to promise that she wouldn't",OH

8324,write to me or send me any word. That heart-and-cross sign was her scheme.,OH

8325,Whenever she wanted to see me in particular she managed to put that mark on,OH

8326,somethin' at the ranch that she knew I'd see. And I never laid eyes on it but,OH

8327,what I burnt the wind for the ranch the same night. I used to see her in that,OH

8328,"coma mott back of the little horse-corral.""",OH

8329,"""We knowed it,"" chanted Baldy; ""but we never let on. We was all for you. We",OH

8330,knowed why you always kept that fast paint in camp. And when we see that,OH

8331,gizzard-and-crossbones figured out on the truck from the ranch we knowed,OH

8332,old Pinto was goin' to eat up miles that night instead of grass. You remember,OH

8333,Scurry--that educated horse-wrangler we had-- the college fellow that tanglefoot drove to the range? Whenever Scurry saw that come-meet-your-honey,OH

8334,"brand on anything from the ranch, he'd wave his hand like that, and say, 'Our",OH

8335,"friend Lee Andrews will again swim the Hell's point to-night.'""",OH

8336,"""The last time Santa sent me the sign,"" said Webb, ""was once when she was",OH

8337,"sick. I noticed it as soon as I hit camp, and I galloped Pinto forty mile that",OH

8338,night. She wasn't at the coma mott. I went to the house; and old McAllister,OH

8339,met me at the door. 'Did you come here to get killed?' says he; 'I'll disoblige,OH

8340,you for once. I just started a Mexican to bring you. Santa wants you. Go in,OH

8341,that room and see her. And then come out here and see me.',OH

8342,"""Santa was lyin' in bed pretty sick. But she gives out a kind of a smile, and her",OH

8343,"hand and mine lock horns, and I sets down by the bed-- mud and spurs and",OH

8344,"chaps and all. 'I've heard you ridin' across the grass for hours, Webb,' she says.",OH

8345,'I was sure you'd come. You saw the sign?' she whispers. 'The minute I hit,OH

8346,"camp,' says I. ''Twas marked on the bag of potatoes and onions.' 'They're",OH

8347,"always together,' says she, soft like--'always together in life.' 'They go well",OH

8348,"together,' I says, 'in a stew.' 'I mean hearts and crosses,' says Santa. 'Our sign-to love and to suffer--that's what they mean.'",OH

8349,"""And there was old Doc Musgrove amusin' himself with whisky and a palmleaf fan. And by and by Santa goes to sleep; and Doc feels her forehead; and",OH

8350,he says to me: 'You're not such a bad febrifuge. But you'd better slide out now;,OH

8351,for the diagnosis don't call for you in regular doses. The little lady'll be all,OH

8358,use you as a target. You ain't my idea for a member of the family. But I can use,OH

8359,you on the Nopalito if you'll keep outside of a radius with the ranch-house in,OH

8360,"the middle of it. You go upstairs and lay down on a cot, and when you get",OH

8361,"some sleep we'll talk it over.'""",OH

8362,"Baldy Woods pulled down his hat, and uncurled his leg from his saddle- horn.",OH

8363,"Webb shortened his rein, and his pony danced, anxious to be off. The two men",OH

8364,shook hands with Western ceremony.,OH

8365,"""/Adios/, Baldy,"" said Webb, ""I'm glad I seen you and had this talk.""",OH

8366,"With a pounding rush that sounded like the rise of a covey of quail, the riders",OH

8367,sped away toward different points of the compass. A hundred yards on his,OH

8368,"route Baldy reined in on the top of a bare knoll, and emitted a yell. He swayed",OH

8369,"on his horse; had he been on foot, the earth would have risen and conquered",OH

8370,"him; but in the saddle he was a master of equilibrium, and laughed at whisky,",OH

8371,and despised the centre of gravity.,OH

8372,Webb turned in his saddle at the signal.,OH

8373,"""If I was you,"" came Baldy's strident and perverting tones, ""I'd be king!""",OH

8374,At eight o'clock on the following morning Bud Turner rolled from his saddle,OH

8375,"in front of the Nopalito ranch-house, and stumbled with whizzing rowels",OH

8376,toward the gallery. Bud was in charge of the bunch of beef-cattle that was to,OH

8377,strike the trail that morning for San Antonio. Mrs. Yeager was on the gallery,OH

8378,watering a cluster of hyacinths growing in a red earthenware jar.,OH

8379,"""King"" McAllister had bequeathed to his daughter many of his strong",OH

8380,"characteristics--his resolution, his gay courage, his contumacious self-reliance,",OH

8381,his pride as a reigning monarch of hoofs and horns. /Allegro/ and /fortissimo/,OH

8382,"had been McAllister's temp and tone. In Santa they survived, transposed to the",OH

8383,"feminine key. Substantially, she preserved the image of the mother who had",OH

8384,been summoned to wander in other and less finite green pastures long before,OH

8385,the waxing herds of kine had conferred royalty upon the house. She had her,OH

8386,"mother's slim, strong figure and grave, soft prettiness that relieved in her the",OH

8387,severity of the imperious McAllister eye and the McAllister air of royal,OH

8388,independence.,OH

8389,Webb stood on one end of the gallery giving orders to two or three sub-bosses,OH

8390,of various camps and outfits who had ridden in for instructions.,OH

8391,"""Morning,"" said Bud briefly. ""Where do you want them beeves to go in town-to Barber's, as usual?""",OH

8392,"Now, to answer that had been the prerogative of the queen. All the reins of",OH

8393,"business--buying, selling, and banking--had been held by her capable fingers.",OH

8394,The handling of cattle had been entrusted fully to her husband. In the days of,OH

8395,"""King"" McAllister, Santa had been his secretary and helper; and she had",OH

8396,"continued her work with wisdom and profit. But before she could reply, the",OH

8397,prince-consort spake up with calm decision:,OH

8398,"""You drive that bunch to Zimmerman and Nesbit's pens. I spoke to",OH

8399,"Zimmerman about it some time ago.""",OH

8400,Bud turned on his high boot-heels.,OH

8401,"""Wait!"" called Santa quickly. She looked at her husband with surprise in her",OH

8402,steady gray eyes.,OH

8403,"""Why, what do you mean, Webb?"" she asked, with a small wrinkle gathering",OH

8404,"between her brows. ""I never deal with Zimmerman and Nesbit. Barber has",OH

8405,handled every head of stock from this ranch in that market for five years. I'm,OH

8406,"not going to take the business out of his hands."" She faced Bud Turner.",OH

8407,"""Deliver those cattle to Barber,"" she concluded positively.",OH

8408,"Bud gazed impartially at the water-jar hanging on the gallery, stood on his",OH

8409,"other leg, and chewed a mesquite-leaf.",OH

8410,"""I want this bunch of beeves to go to Zimmerman and Nesbit,"" said Webb,",OH

8411,with a frosty light in his blue eyes.,OH

8412,"""Nonsense,"" said Santa impatiently. ""You'd better start on, Bud, so as to noon",OH

8413,at the Little Elm water-hole. Tell Barber we'll have another lot of culls ready in,OH

8414,"about a month.""",OH

8415,Bud allowed a hesitating eye to steal upward and meet Webb's. Webb saw,OH

8416,"apology in his look, and fancied he saw commiseration.",OH

8417,"""You deliver them cattle,"" he said grimly, ""to--""",OH

8418,"""Barber,"" finished Santa sharply. ""Let that settle it. Is there anything else you",OH

8419,"are waiting for, Bud?""",OH

8420,"""No, m'm,"" said Bud. But before going he lingered while a cow's tail could",OH

8421,have switched thrice; for man is man's ally; and even the Philistines must have,OH

8422,blushed when they took Samson in the way they did.,OH

8423,"""You hear your boss!"" cried Webb sardonically. He took off his hat, and bowed",OH

8424,until it touched the floor before his wife.,OH

8425,"""Webb,"" said Santa rebukingly, ""you're acting mighty foolish to-day.""",OH

8426,"""Court fool, your Majesty,"" said Webb, in his slow tones, which had changed",OH

8427,"their quality. ""What else can you expect? Let me tell you. I was a man before I",OH

8428,married a cattle-queen. What am I now? The laughing-stock of the camps. I'll,OH

8429,"be a man again.""",OH

8430,Santa looked at him closely.,OH

8431,"""Don't be unreasonable, Webb,"" she said calmly. ""You haven't been slighted in",OH

8432,any way. Do I ever interfere in your management of the cattle? I know the,OH

8433,business side of the ranch much better than you do. I learned it from Dad. Be,OH

8434,"sensible.""",OH

8435,"""Kingdoms and queendoms,"" said Webb, ""don't suit me unless I am in the",OH

8436,"pictures, too. I punch the cattle and you wear the crown. All right. I'd rather be",OH

8437,High Lord Chancellor of a cow-camp than the eight-spot in a queen-high,OH

8438,"flush. It's your ranch; and Barber gets the beeves.""",OH

8439,Webb's horse was tied to the rack. He walked into the house and brought out,OH

8440,"his roll of blankets that he never took with him except on long rides, and his",OH

8441,"""slicker,"" and his longest stake-rope of plaited raw-hide. These he began to tie",OH

8442,"deliberately upon his saddle. Santa, a little pale, followed him.",OH

8443,"Webb swung up into the saddle. His serious, smooth face was without",OH

8444,expression except for a stubborn light that smouldered in his eyes.,OH

8445,"""There's a herd of cows and calves,"" said he, ""near the Hondo water- hole on",OH

8446,the Frio that ought to be moved away from timber. Lobos have killed three of,OH

8447,"the calves. I forgot to leave orders. You'd better tell Simms to attend to it.""",OH

8448,"Santa laid a hand on the horse's bridle, and looked her husband in the eye.",OH

8449,"""Are you going to leave me, Webb?"" she asked quietly.",OH

8450,"""I am going to be a man again,"" he answered.",OH

8451,"""I wish you success in a praiseworthy attempt,"" she said, with a sudden",OH

8452,coldness. She turned and walked directly into the house.,OH

8453,Webb Yeager rode to the southeast as straight as the topography of West Texas,OH

8454,permitted. And when he reached the horizon he might have ridden on into blue,OH

8455,"space as far as knowledge of him on the Nopalito went. And the days, with",OH

8456,"Sundays at their head, formed into hebdomadal squads; and the weeks,",OH

8457,"captained by the full moon, closed ranks into menstrual companies crying",OH

8458,"""Tempus fugit"" on their banners; and the months marched on toward the vast",OH

8459,camp-ground of the years; but Webb Yeager came no more to the dominions,OH

8460,of his queen.,OH

8461,"One day a being named Bartholomew, a sheep-man--and therefore of little",OH

8462,"account--from the lower Rio Grande country, rode in sight of the Nopalito",OH

8463,"ranch-house, and felt hunger assail him. /Ex consuetudine/ he was soon seated",OH

8464,at the mid-day dining table of that hospitable kingdom. Talk like water gushed,OH

8465,from him: he might have been smitten with Aaron's rod--that is your gentle,OH

8466,shepherd when an audience is vouchsafed him whose ears are not overgrown,OH

8467,with wool.,OH

8468,"""Missis Yeager,"" he babbled, ""I see a man the other day on the Rancho Seco",OH

8469,down in Hidalgo County by your name--Webb Yeager was his. He'd just been,OH

8470,"engaged as manager. He was a tall, light-haired man, not saying much.",OH

8471,"Perhaps he was some kin of yours, do you think?""",OH

8472,"""A husband,"" said Santa cordially. ""The Seco has done well. Mr. Yeager is one",OH

8473,"of the best stockmen in the West.""",OH

8474,The dropping out of a prince-consort rarely disorganises a monarchy. Queen,OH

8475,"Santa had appointed as /mayordomo/ of the ranch a trusty subject, named",OH

8476,"Ramsay, who had been one of her father's faithful vassals. And there was",OH

8477,scarcely a ripple on the Nopalito ranch save when the gulf-breeze created,OH

8478,undulations in the grass of its wide acres.,OH

8479,For several years the Nopalito had been making experiments with an English,OH

8480,breed of cattle that looked down with aristocratic contempt upon the Texas,OH

8481,long-horns. The experiments were found satisfactory; and a pasture had been,OH

8482,set aside for the blue-bloods. The fame of them had gone forth into the,OH

8483,"chaparral and pear as far as men ride in saddles. Other ranches woke up,",OH

8484,"rubbed their eyes, and looked with new dissatisfaction upon the long-horns.",OH

8485,"As a consequence, one day a sunburned, capable, silk-kerchiefed nonchalant",OH

8486,"youth, garnished with revolvers, and attended by three Mexican /vaqueros/,",OH

8487,alighted at the Nopalito ranch and presented the following business-like epistle,OH

8488,to the queen thereof:,OH

8489,Mrs. Yeager--The Nopalito Ranch:,OH

8490,Dear Madam:,OH

8491,I am instructed by the owners of the Rancho Seco to purchase 100,OH

8492,head of two and three-year-old cows of the Sussex breed owned by,OH

8493,you. If you can fill the order please deliver the cattle to the,OH

8494,bearer; and a check will be forwarded to you at once.,OH

8495,"Respectfully,",OH

8496,"Webster Yeager,",OH

8497,Manager the Rancho Seco.,OH

8498,"Business is business, even--very scantily did it escape being written",OH

8499,"""especially""--in a kingdom.",OH

8500,That night the 100 head of cattle were driven up from the pasture and penned,OH

8501,in a corral near the ranch-house for delivery in the morning.,OH

8502,"When night closed down and the house was still, did Santa Yeager throw",OH

8503,"herself down, clasping that formal note to her bosom, weeping, and calling out",OH

8504,a name that pride (either in one or the other) had kept from her lips many a,OH

8505,"day? Or did she file the letter, in her business way, retaining her royal balance",OH

8506,and strength?,OH

8507,"Wonder, if you will; but royalty is sacred; and there is a veil. But this much",OH

8508,you shall learn:,OH

8509,"At midnight Santa slipped softly out of the ranch-house, clothed in something",OH

8510,dark and plain. She paused for a moment under the live-oak trees. The prairies,OH

8511,"were somewhat dim, and the moonlight was pale orange, diluted with particles",OH

8512,"of an impalpable, flying mist. But the mock-bird whistled on every bough of",OH

8513,vantage; leagues of flowers scented the air; and a kindergarten of little,OH

8514,shadowy rabbits leaped and played in an open space near by. Santa turned her,OH

8515,face to the southeast and threw three kisses thitherward; for there was none to,OH

8516,see.,OH

8517,"Then she sped silently to the blacksmith-shop, fifty yards away; and what she",OH

8518,did there can only be surmised. But the forge glowed red; and there was a faint,OH

8519,hammering such as Cupid might make when he sharpens his arrow-points.,OH

8520,"Later she came forth with a queer-shaped, handled thing in one hand, and a",OH

8521,"portable furnace, such as are seen in branding-camps, in the other. To the",OH

8522,corral where the Sussex cattle were penned she sped with these things swiftly,OH

8523,in the moonlight.,OH

8524,She opened the gate and slipped inside the corral. The Sussex cattle were,OH

8525,mostly a dark red. But among this bunch was one that was milky white-notable among the others.,OH

8526,And now Santa shook from her shoulder something that we had not seen,OH

8527,"before--a rope lasso. She freed the loop of it, coiling the length in her left",OH

8528,"hand, and plunged into the thick of the cattle.",OH

8529,"The white cow was her object. She swung the lasso, which caught one horn",OH

8530,and slipped off. The next throw encircled the forefeet and the animal fell,OH

8531,heavily. Santa made for it like a panther; but it scrambled up and dashed,OH

8532,"against her, knocking her over like a blade of grass.",OH

8533,"Again she made her cast, while the aroused cattle milled around the four sides",OH

8534,of the corral in a plunging mass. This throw was fair; the white cow came to,OH

8535,earth again; and before it could rise Santa had made the lasso fast around a,OH

8536,"post of the corral with a swift and simple knot, and had leaped upon the cow",OH

8537,again with the rawhide hobbles.,OH

8538,In one minute the feet of the animal were tied (no record-breaking deed) and,OH

8539,"Santa leaned against the corral for the same space of time, panting and lax.",OH

8540,"And then she ran swiftly to her furnace at the gate and brought the brandingiron, queerly shaped and white-hot.",OH

8541,"The bellow of the outraged white cow, as the iron was applied, should have",OH

8542,stirred the slumbering auricular nerves and consciences of the near-by subjects,OH

8543,"of the Nopalito, but it did not. And it was amid the deepest nocturnal silence",OH

8544,that Santa ran like a lapwing back to the ranch-house and there fell upon a cot,OH

8545,and sobbed--sobbed as though queens had hearts as simple ranchmen's wives,OH

8546,"have, and as though she would gladly make kings of prince-consorts, should",OH

8547,they ride back again from over the hills and far away.,OH

8548,"In the morning the capable, revolvered youth and his /vaqueros/ set forth,",OH

8549,driving the bunch of Sussex cattle across the prairies to the Rancho Seco.,OH

8550,"Ninety miles it was; a six days' journey, grazing and watering the animals on",OH

8551,the way.,OH

8552,The beasts arrived at Rancho Seco one evening at dusk; and were received and,OH

8553,counted by the foreman of the ranch.,OH

8554,The next morning at eight o'clock a horseman loped out of the brush to the,OH

8555,"Nopalito ranch-house. He dismounted stiffly, and strode, with whizzing spurs,",OH

8556,"to the house. His horse gave a great sigh and swayed foam-streaked, with",OH

8557,down-drooping head and closed eyes.,OH

8558,"But waste not your pity upon Belshazzar, the flea-bitten sorrel. To-day, in",OH

8560,record-holder of long-distance rides.,OH

8561,"The horseman stumbled into the house. Two arms fell around his neck, and",OH

8615,made the cabin seem like home at once.,OH

8616,Never believe it when they tell you riches don't bring happiness. If you could,OH

8618,in the window and absorbing in that Buckle stuff through his specs you'd have,OH

8619,seen a picture of content that would have made Rockefeller jealous. And I was,OH

8620,"learning to pick out ""Old Zip Coon"" on the banjo, and the cuckoo was on time",OH

8925,"him? He pretends he hasn't got a thing in his hand, and that the cat don't see",OH

8926,"him, and that he don't see the cat. That's the idea. Never drag her hand out",OH

8927,where she'll have to take notice of it. Don't let her know that you think she,OH

8928,knows you have the least idea she is aware you are holding her hand. That was,OH

8929,my rule of tactics; and as far as Paisley's serenade about hostilities and,OH

8930,"misadventure went, he might as well have been reading to her a time- table of",OH

9009,educational system of the United States should be in the hands of the weather,OH

9011,college professors shouldn't be transferred to the meteorological department.,OH

9012,They have been learned to read; and they could very easily glance at the,OH

9013,morning papers and then wire in to the main office what kind of weather to,OH

9014,expect. But there's the other side of the proposition. I am going on to tell you,OH

9015,how the weather furnished me and Idaho Green with an elegant education.,OH

9016,We was up in the Bitter Root Mountains over the Montana line prospecting for,OH

9017,"gold. A chin-whiskered man in Walla-Walla, carrying a line of hope as excess",OH

9018,"baggage, had grubstaked us; and there we was in the foothills pecking away,",OH

9019,with enough grub on hand to last an army through a peace conference.,OH

9020,"Along one day comes a mail-rider over the mountains from Carlos, and stops",OH

9021,"to eat three cans of greengages, and leave us a newspaper of modern date. This",OH

9022,"paper prints a system of premonitions of the weather, and the card it dealt",OH

9023,"Bitter Root Mountains from the bottom of the deck was ""warmer and fair, with",OH

9024,"light westerly breezes.""",OH

9025,"That evening it began to snow, with the wind strong in the east. Me and Idaho",OH

9026,"moved camp into an old empty cabin higher up the mountain, thinking it was",OH

9027,only a November flurry. But after falling three foot on a level it went to work,OH

9028,in earnest; and we knew we was snowed in. We got in plenty of firewood,OH

9029,"before it got deep, and we had grub enough for two months, so we let the",OH

9030,elements rage and cut up all they thought proper.,OH

9031,If you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in a,OH

9032,eighteen by twenty-foot cabin for a month. Human nature won't stand it.,OH

9033,When the first snowflakes fell me and Idaho Green laughed at each other's,OH

9034,jokes and praised the stuff we turned out of a skillet and called bread. At the,OH

9035,end of three weeks Idaho makes this kind of a edict to me. Says he:,OH

9036,"""I never exactly heard sour milk dropping out of a balloon on the bottom of a",OH

9037,"tin pan, but I have an idea it would be music of the spears compared to this",OH

9038,attenuated stream of asphyxiated thought that emanates out of your organs of,OH

9039,conversation. The kind of half- masticated noises that you emit every day puts,OH

9045,"here cabin would be wagging a tail just at present.""",OH

9046,"This way we goes on for two or three days, and then we quits speaking to one",OH

9047,"another. We divides up the cooking implements, and Idaho cooks his grub on",OH

9048,"one side of the fireplace, and me on the other. The snow is up to the windows,",OH

9049,and we have to keep a fire all day.,OH

9050,"You see me and Idaho never had any education beyond reading and doing ""if",OH

9051,"John had three apples and James five"" on a slate. We never felt any special",OH

9052,"need for a university degree, though we had acquired a species of intrinsic",OH

9053,intelligence in knocking around the world that we could use in emergencies.,OH

9054,"But, snowbound in that cabin in the Bitter Roots, we felt for the first time that",OH

9055,if we had studied Homer or Greek and fractions and the higher branches of,OH

9056,"information, we'd have had some resources in the line of meditation and",OH

9057,private thought. I've seen them Eastern college fellows working in camps all,OH

9058,"through the West, and I never noticed but what education was less of a",OH

9059,"drawback to 'em than you would think. Why, once over on Snake River, when",OH

9060,"Andrew McWilliams' saddle horse got the botts, he sent a buckboard ten miles",OH

9061,for one of these strangers that claimed to be a botanist. But that horse died.,OH

9062,One morning Idaho was poking around with a stick on top of a little shelf that,OH

9063,"was too high to reach. Two books fell down to the floor. I started toward 'em,",OH

9064,but caught Idaho's eye. He speaks for the first time in a week.,OH

9065,"""Don't burn your fingers,"" says he. ""In spite of the fact that you're only fit to",OH

9066,"be the companion of a sleeping mud-turtle, I'll give you a square deal. And",OH

9067,that's more than your parents did when they turned you loose in the world with,OH

9072,each of us got on his side of the house and went to reading.,OH

9073,I never was as glad to see a ten-ounce nugget as I was that book. And Idaho,OH

9074,took at his like a kid looks at a stick of candy.,OH

9075,"Mine was a little book about five by six inches called ""Herkimer's Handbook",OH

9076,"of Indispensable Information."" I may be wrong, but I think that was the",OH

9077,greatest book that ever was written. I've got it to-day; and I can stump you or,OH

9078,any man fifty times in five minutes with the information in it. Talk about,OH

9079,Solomon or the New York /Tribune/! Herkimer had cases on both of 'em. That,OH

9080,man must have put in fifty years and travelled a million miles to find out all,OH

9081,"that stuff. There was the population of all cities in it, and the way to tell a girl's",OH

9082,"age, and the number of teeth a camel has. It told you the longest tunnel in the",OH

9083,"world, the number of the stars, how long it takes for chicken pox to break out,",OH

9084,"what a lady's neck ought to measure, the veto powers of Governors, the dates",OH

9085,"of the Roman aqueducts, how many pounds of rice going without three beers a",OH

9086,"day would buy, the average annual temperature of Augusta, Maine, the",OH

9087,"quantity of seed required to plant an acre of carrots in drills, antidotes for",OH

9088,"poisons, the number of hairs on a blond lady's head, how to preserve eggs, the",OH

9089,"height of all the mountains in the world, and the dates of all wars and battles,",OH

9090,"and how to restore drowned persons, and sunstroke, and the number of tacks",OH

9091,"in a pound, and how to make dynamite and flowers and beds, and what to do",OH

9092,before the doctor comes--and a hundred times as many things besides. If there,OH

9093,was anything Herkimer didn't know I didn't miss it out of the book.,OH

9094,I sat and read that book for four hours. All the wonders of education was,OH

9095,"compressed in it. I forgot the snow, and I forgot that me and old Idaho was on",OH

9096,the outs. He was sitting still on a stool reading away with a kind of partly soft,OH

9097,and partly mysterious look shining through his tan-bark whiskers.,OH

9098,"""Idaho,"" says I, ""what kind of a book is yours?""",OH

9099,"Idaho must have forgot, too, for he answered moderate, without any slander or",OH

9112,"""You're welcome to it,"" says I. ""What I want is a disinterested statement of",OH

9115,"""What you've got,"" says Idaho, ""is statistics, the lowest grade of information",OH

9120,"Idaho, ""and I have sensations of scorn for that truck of yours that tries to",OH

9124,So that's the way me and Idaho had it. Day and night all the excitement we got,OH

9125,was studying our books. That snowstorm sure fixed us with a fine lot of,OH

9126,"attainments apiece. By the time the snow melted, if you had stepped up to me",OH

9137,sure.,OH

9138,"This Homer K. M., from what leaked out of his libretto through Idaho, seemed",OH

9177,"""That's easy to account for,"" says I, ""when you happen to know that you've got",OH

9207,"and obesity. After nine years of Idaho's society, Mrs. Sampson,"" I winds up, ""I",OH

9208,"should hate to impute him, and I should hate to see him imputed.""",OH

9209,"""It's right plausible of you, Mr. Pratt,"" says Mrs. Sampson, ""to take up the",OH

9216,"corrupted his demeanour.""",OH

9217,"""It has,"" says Mrs. Sampson. ""Ever since I knew him he has been reciting to",OH

9223,"pinned a note. Now, Mr. Pratt, you know a lady when you see her; and you",OH

9224,know how I stand in Rosa society. Do you think for a moment that I'd skip out,OH

9225,"to the woods with a man along with a jug of wine and a loaf of bread, and go",OH

9226,singing and cavorting up and down under the trees with him? I take a little,OH

9227,"claret with my meals, but I'm not in the habit of packing a jug of it into the",OH

9228,brush and raising Cain in any such style as that. And of course he'd bring his,OH

9229,"book of verses along, too. He said so. Let him go on his scandalous picnics",OH

9230,alone! Or let him take his Ruby Ott with him. I reckon she wouldn't kick,OH

9231,unless it was on account of there being too much bread along. And what do,OH

9232,"you think of your gentleman friend now, Mr. Pratt?""",OH

9233,"""Well, 'm,"" says I, ""it may be that Idaho's invitation was a kind of poetry, and",OH

9234,meant no harm. May be it belonged to the class of rhymes they call figurative.,OH

9235,"They offend law and order, but they get sent through the mails on the grounds",OH

9236,that they mean something that they don't say. I'd be glad on Idaho's account if,OH

9237,"you'd overlook it,"" says I, ""and let us extricate our minds from the low regions",OH

9250,show it was sixty years old. At the depth of two thousand feet it would become,OH

9251,coal in three thousand years. The deepest coal mine in the world is at,OH

9252,"Killingworth, near Newcastle. A box four feet long, three feet wide, and two",OH

9253,"feet eight inches deep will hold one ton of coal. If an artery is cut, compress it",OH

9295,house. If I die first I'll write you a letter and tell you if it's any worse down,OH

9296,there than the inside of that yellow house was; but don't believe it yet. I was a,OH

9297,heap more cooked than the hurry-up orders of broiled chicken that you get in,OH

9299,"about to shame Herkimer, but the firemen helped me with their little stream of",OH

9781,buy anything they wanted; but they didn't know what to want. Their ideas of,OH

9783,"there was anything else in the world to throw away fortunes on, they had never",OH

10021,From an inside pocket he drew a tightly folded newspaper with much- worn,OH

10037,HYGEIA AT THE SOLITO,OH

10038,If you are knowing in the chronicles of the ring you will recall to mind an,OH

10039,"event in the early 'nineties when, for a minute and sundry odd seconds, a",OH

10040,"champion and a ""would-be"" faced each other on the alien side of an",OH

10041,international river. So brief a conflict had rarely imposed upon the fair promise,OH

10042,"of true sport. The reporters made what they could of it, but, divested of",OH

10043,"padding, the action was sadly fugacious. The champion merely smote his",OH

10044,"victim, turned his back upon him, remarking, ""I know what I done to dat stiff,""",OH

10045,and extended an arm like a ship's mast for his glove to be removed.,OH

10046,Which accounts for a trainload of extremely disgusted gentlemen in an uproar,OH

10047,of fancy vests and neck-wear being spilled from their pullmans in San Antonio,OH

10048,in the early morning following the fight. Which also partly accounts for the,OH

10049,"unhappy predicament in which ""Cricket"" McGuire found himself as he",OH

10050,"tumbled from his car and sat upon the depot platform, torn by a spasm of that",OH

10051,"hollow, racking cough so familiar to San Antonian ears. At that time, in the",OH

10052,"uncertain light of dawn, that way passed Curtis Raidler, the Nueces County",OH

10053,cattleman--may his shadow never measure under six foot two.,OH

10054,"The cattleman, out this early to catch the south-bound for his ranch station,",OH

10055,"stopped at the side of the distressed patron of sport, and spoke in the kindly",OH

10056,"drawl of his ilk and region, ""Got it pretty bad, bud?""",OH

10057,"""Cricket"" McGuire, ex-feather-weight prizefighter, tout, jockey, follower of",OH

10058,"the ""ponies,"" all-round sport, and manipulator of the gum balls and walnut",OH

10060,"""G'wan,"" he rasped, ""telegraph pole. I didn't ring for yer.""",OH

10061,"Another paroxysm wrung him, and he leaned limply against a convenient",OH

10062,"baggage truck. Raidler waited patiently, glancing around at the white hats,",OH

10063,"short overcoats, and big cigars thronging the platform. ""You're from the No'th,",OH

10064,"ain't you, bud?"" he asked when the other was partially recovered. ""Come down",OH

10065,"to see the fight?""",OH

10066,"""Fight!"" snapped McGuire. ""Puss-in-the-corner! 'Twas a hypodermic injection.",OH

10067,"Handed him just one like a squirt of dope, and he's asleep, and no tanbark",OH

10068,"needed in front of his residence. Fight!"" He rattled a bit, coughed, and went",OH

10069,"on, hardly addressing the cattleman, but rather for the relief of voicing his",OH

10070,"troubles. ""No more dead sure t'ings for me. But Rus Sage himself would have",OH

10071,snatched at it. Five to one dat de boy from Cork wouldn't stay t'ree rounds is,OH

10072,"what I invested in. Put my last cent on, and could already smell the sawdust in",OH

10078,"long?""",OH

10079,"""Lungs,"" said McGuire comprehensively. ""I got it. The croaker says I'll come",OH

10080,to time for six months longer--maybe a year if I hold my gait. I wanted to,OH

10081,settle down and take care of myself. Dat's why I speculated on dat five to one,OH

10082,perhaps. I had a t'ousand iron dollars saved up. If I winned I was goin' to buy,OH

10083,"Delaney's cafe. Who'd a t'ought dat stiff would take a nap in de foist round-say?""",OH

10084,"""It's a hard deal,"" commented Raidler, looking down at the diminutive form of",OH

10085,"McGuire crumpled against the truck. ""But you go to a hotel and rest. There's",OH

10086,"the Menger and the Maverick, and--""",OH

10087,"""And the Fi'th Av'noo, and the Waldorf-Astoria,"" mimicked McGuire. ""Told",OH

10088,you I went broke. I'm on de bum proper. I've got one dime left. Maybe a trip to,OH

10089,"Europe or a sail in me private yacht would fix me up-- pa-per!""",OH

10090,"He flung his dime at a newsboy, got his /Express/, propped his back against",OH

10091,"the truck, and was at once rapt in the account of his Waterloo, as expanded by",OH

10092,the ingenious press.,OH

10093,"Curtis Raidler interrogated an enormous gold watch, and laid his hand on",OH

10094,McGuire's shoulder.,OH

10095,"""Come on, bud,"" he said. ""We got three minutes to catch the train.""",OH

10096,Sarcasm seemed to be McGuire's vein.,OH

10097,"""You ain't seen me cash in any chips or call a turn since I told you I was broke,",OH

10098,"a minute ago, have you? Friend, chase yourself away.""",OH

10099,"""You're going down to my ranch,"" said the cattleman, ""and stay till you get",OH

10100,"well. Six months'll fix you good as new."" He lifted McGuire with one hand,",OH

10101,and half-dragged him in the direction of the train.,OH

10102,"""What about the money?"" said McGuire, struggling weakly to escape.",OH

10103,"""Money for what?"" asked Raidler, puzzled. They eyed each other, not",OH

10104,"understanding, for they touched only as at the gear of bevelled cog- wheels--at",OH

10105,"right angles, and moving upon different axes.",OH

10106,"Passengers on the south-bound saw them seated together, and wondered at the",OH

10107,"conflux of two such antipodes. McGuire was five feet one, with a countenance",OH

10108,"belonging to either Yokohama or Dublin. Bright-beady of eye, bony of cheek",OH

10109,"and jaw, scarred, toughened, broken and reknit, indestructible, grisly,",OH

10110,"gladiatorial as a hornet, he was a type neither new nor unfamiliar. Raidler was",OH

10111,"the product of a different soil. Six feet two in height, miles broad, and no",OH

10112,"deeper than a crystal brook, he represented the union of the West and South.",OH

10113,"Few accurate pictures of his kind have been made, for art galleries are so small",OH

10114,"and the mutoscope is as yet unknown in Texas. After all, the only possible",OH

10115,medium of portrayal of Raidler's kind would be the fresco--something high,OH

10116,and simple and cool and unframed.,OH

10117,They were rolling southward on the International. The timber was huddling,OH

10118,"into little, dense green motts at rare distances before the inundation of the",OH

10119,"downright, vert prairies. This was the land of the ranches; the domain of the",OH

10120,kings of the kine.,OH

10121,"McGuire sat, collapsed into his corner of the seat, receiving with acid",OH

10122,"suspicion the conversation of the cattleman. What was the ""game"" of this big",OH

10123,"""geezer"" who was carrying him off? Altruism would have been McGuire's last",OH

10124,"guess. ""He ain't no farmer,"" thought the captive, ""and he ain't no con man, for",OH

10125,"sure. W'at's his lay? You trail in, Cricket, and see how many cards he draws.",OH

10126,"You're up against it, anyhow. You got a nickel and gallopin' consumption, and",OH

10127,"you better lay low. Lay low and see w'at's his game.""",OH

10128,"At Rincon, a hundred miles from San Antonio, they left the train for a",OH

10129,buckboard which was waiting there for Raidler. In this they travelled the thirty,OH

10130,"miles between the station and their destination. If anything could, this drive",OH

10131,should have stirred the acrimonious McGuire to a sense of his ransom. They,OH

10132,sped upon velvety wheels across an exhilarant savanna. The pair of Spanish,OH

10133,"ponies struck a nimble, tireless trot, which gait they occasionally relieved by a",OH

10134,"wild, untrammelled gallop. The air was wine and seltzer, perfumed, as they",OH

10135,"absorbed it, with the delicate redolence of prairie flowers. The road perished,",OH

10136,"and the buckboard swam the uncharted billows of the grass itself, steered by",OH

10137,"the practised hand of Raidler, to whom each tiny distant mott of trees was a",OH

10138,"signboard, each convolution of the low hills a voucher of course and distance.",OH

10139,"But McGuire reclined upon his spine, seeing nothing but a desert, and",OH

10140,"receiving the cattleman's advances with sullen distrust. ""W'at's he up to?"" was",OH

10141,"the burden of his thoughts; ""w'at kind of a gold brick has the big guy got to",OH

10142,"sell?"" McGuire was only applying the measure of the streets he had walked to",OH

10143,a range bounded by the horizon and the fourth dimension.,OH

10144,"A week before, while riding the prairies, Raidler had come upon a sick and",OH

10145,weakling calf deserted and bawling. Without dismounting he had reached and,OH

10146,"slung the distressed bossy across his saddle, and dropped it at the ranch for the",OH

10147,"boys to attend to. It was impossible for McGuire to know or comprehend that,",OH

10148,"in the eyes of the cattleman, his case and that of the calf were identical in",OH

10149,interest and demand upon his assistance. A creature was ill and helpless; he,OH

10150,had the power to render aid--these were the only postulates required for the,OH

10151,cattleman to act. They formed his system of logic and the most of his creed.,OH

10152,McGuire was the seventh invalid whom Raidler had picked up thus casually in,OH

10153,"San Antonio, where so many thousand go for the ozone that is said to linger",OH

10154,about its contracted streets. Five of them had been guests of Solito Ranch until,OH

10155,"they had been able to leave, cured or better, and exhausting the vocabulary of",OH

10156,"tearful gratitude. One came too late, but rested very comfortably, at last, under",OH

10157,a ratama tree in the garden.,OH

10158,"So, then, it was no surprise to the ranchhold when the buckboard spun to the",OH

10159,"door, and Raidler took up his debile /protege/ like a handful of rags and set",OH

10160,him down upon the gallery.,OH

10161,McGuire looked upon things strange to him. The ranch-house was the best in,OH

10162,"the country. It was built of brick hauled one hundred miles by wagon, but it",OH

10163,"was of but one story, and its four rooms were completely encircled by a mud",OH

10164,"floor ""gallery."" The miscellaneous setting of horses, dogs, saddles, wagons,",OH

10165,"guns, and cow-punchers' paraphernalia oppressed the metropolitan eyes of the",OH

10166,wrecked sportsman.,OH

10167,"""Well, here we are at home,"" said Raidler, cheeringly.",OH

10168,"""It's a h--l of a looking place,"" said McGuire promptly, as he rolled upon the",OH

10169,gallery floor in a fit of coughing.,OH

10170,"""We'll try to make it comfortable for you, buddy,"" said the cattleman gently. ""It",OH

10171,"ain't fine inside; but it's the outdoors, anyway, that'll do you the most good.",OH

10172,"This'll be your room, in here. Anything we got, you ask for it.""",OH

10173,He led McGuire into the east room. The floor was bare and clean. White,OH

10174,curtains waved in the gulf breeze through the open windows. A big willow,OH

10175,"rocker, two straight chairs, a long table covered with newspapers, pipes,",OH

10176,"tobacco, spurs, and cartridges stood in the centre. Some well-mounted heads",OH

10177,"of deer and one of an enormous black javeli projected from the walls. A wide,",OH

10178,cool cot-bed stood in a corner. Nueces County people regarded this guest,OH

10179,chamber as fit for a prince. McGuire showed his eyeteeth at it. He took out his,OH

10180,nickel and spun it up to the ceiling.,OH

10181,"""T'ought I was lyin' about the money, did ye? Well, you can frisk me if you",OH

10182,"wanter. Dat's the last simoleon in the treasury. Who's goin' to pay?""",OH

10183,The cattleman's clear grey eyes looked steadily from under his grizzly brows,OH

10184,"into the huckleberry optics of his guest. After a little he said simply, and not",OH

10185,"ungraciously, ""I'll be much obliged to you, son, if you won't mention money",OH

10186,any more. Once was quite a plenty. Folks I ask to my ranch don't have to pay,OH

10187,"anything, and they very scarcely ever offers it. Supper'll be ready in half an",OH

10188,"hour. There's water in the pitcher, and some, cooler, to drink, in that red jar",OH

10189,"hanging on the gallery.""",OH

10190,"""Where's the bell?"" asked McGuire, looking about.",OH

10191,"""Bell for what?""",OH

10192,"""Bell to ring for things. I can't--see here,"" he exploded in a sudden, weak fury,",OH

10193,"""I never asked you to bring me here. I never held you up for a cent. I never",OH

10194,gave you a hard-luck story till you asked me. Here I am fifty miles from a,OH

10195,"bellboy or a cocktail. I'm sick. I can't hustle. Gee! but I'm up against it!""",OH

10196,McGuire fell upon the cot and sobbed shiveringly.,OH

10197,"Raidler went to the door and called. A slender, bright-complexioned Mexican",OH

10198,youth about twenty came quickly. Raidler spoke to him in Spanish.,OH

10199,"""Ylario, it is in my mind that I promised you the position of /vaquero/ on the",OH

10200,"San Carlos range at the fall /rodeo/.""",OH

10201,"""/Si, senor/, such was your goodness.""",OH

10202,"""Listen. This /senorito/ is my friend. He is very sick. Place yourself at his side.",OH

10203,Attend to his wants at all times. Have much patience and care with him. And,OH

10204,"when he is well, or--and when he is well, instead of /vaquero/ I will make you",OH

10205,"/mayordomo/ of the Rancho de las Piedras. /Esta bueno/?""",OH

10206,"""/Si, si--mil gracias, senor/."" Ylario tried to kneel upon the floor in his",OH

10207,"gratitude, but the cattleman kicked at him benevolently, growling, ""None of",OH

10208,"your opery-house antics, now.""",OH

10209,Ten minutes later Ylario came from McGuire's room and stood before Raidler.,OH

10210,"""The little /senor/,"" he announced, ""presents his compliments"" (Raidler",OH

10211,"credited Ylario with the preliminary) ""and desires some pounded ice, one hot",OH

10212,"bath, one gin feez-z, that the windows be all closed, toast, one shave, one",OH

10213,"Newyorkheral', cigarettes, and to send one telegram.""",OH

10214,"Raidler took a quart bottle of whisky from his medicine cabinet. ""Here, take",OH

10215,"him this,"" he said.",OH

10216,Thus was instituted the reign of terror at the Solito Ranch. For a few weeks,OH

10217,McGuire blustered and boasted and swaggered before the cow- punchers who,OH

10218,rode in for miles around to see this latest importation of Raidler's. He was an,OH

10219,absolutely new experience to them. He explained to them all the intricate,OH

10220,points of sparring and the tricks of training and defence. He opened to their,OH

10221,minds' view all the indecorous life of a tagger after professional sports. His,OH

10222,"jargon of slang was a continuous joy and surprise to them. His gestures, his",OH

10223,"strange poses, his frank ribaldry of tongue and principle fascinated them. He",OH

10224,was like a being from a new world.,OH

10225,"Strange to say, this new world he had entered did not exist to him. He was an",OH

10226,"utter egoist of bricks and mortar. He had dropped out, he felt, into open space",OH

10227,"for a time, and all it contained was an audience for his reminiscences. Neither",OH

10228,"the limitless freedom of the prairie days nor the grand hush of the close-drawn,",OH

10229,spangled nights touched him. All the hues of Aurora could not win him from,OH

10230,"the pink pages of a sporting journal. ""Get something for nothing,"" was his",OH

10231,"mission in life; ""Thirty-seventh"" Street was his goal.",OH

10232,Nearly two months after his arrival he began to complain that he felt worse. It,OH

10233,"was then that he became the ranch's incubus, its harpy, its Old Man of the Sea.",OH

10234,"He shut himself in his room like some venomous kobold or flibbertigibbet,",OH

10235,"whining, complaining, cursing, accusing. The keynote of his plaint was that he",OH

10236,had been inveigled into a gehenna against his will; that he was dying of,OH

10237,neglect and lack of comforts. With all his dire protestations of increasing,OH

10238,"illness, to the eye of others he remained unchanged. His currant-like eyes were",OH

10239,"as bright and diabolic as ever; his voice was as rasping; his callous face, with",OH

10240,"the skin drawn tense as a drum-head, had no flesh to lose. A flush on his",OH

10241,prominent cheek bones each afternoon hinted that a clinical thermometer,OH

10242,"might have revealed a symptom, and percussion might have established the",OH

10243,"fact that McGuire was breathing with only one lung, but his appearance",OH

10244,remained the same.,OH

10245,"In constant attendance upon him was Ylario, whom the coming reward of the",OH

10246,"/mayordomo/ship must have greatly stimulated, for McGuire chained him to a",OH

10247,bitter existence. The air--the man's only chance for life--he commanded to be,OH

10248,kept out by closed windows and drawn curtains. The room was always blue,OH

10249,"and foul with cigarette smoke; whosoever entered it must sit, suffocating, and",OH

10250,listen to the imp's interminable gasconade concerning his scandalous career.,OH

10251,The oddest thing of all was the relation existing between McGuire and his,OH

10252,benefactor. The attitude of the invalid toward the cattleman was something,OH

10253,"like that of a peevish, perverse child toward an indulgent parent. When Raidler",OH

10254,"would leave the ranch McGuire would fall into a fit of malevolent, silent",OH

10255,"sullenness. When he returned, he would be met by a string of violent and",OH

10256,stinging reproaches. Raidler's attitude toward his charge was quite inexplicable,OH

10257,in its way. The cattleman seemed actually to assume and feel the character,OH

10258,assigned to him by McGuire's intemperate accusations--the character of tyrant,OH

10259,and guilty oppressor. He seemed to have adopted the responsibility of the,OH

10260,"fellow's condition, and he always met his tirades with a pacific, patient, and",OH

10261,even remorseful kindness that never altered.,OH

10262,"One day Raidler said to him, ""Try more air, son. You can have the buckboard",OH

10263,and a driver every day if you'll go. Try a week or two in one of the cow camps.,OH

10264,"I'll fix you up plumb comfortable. The ground, and the air next to it--them's",OH

10265,"the things to cure you. I knowed a man from Philadelphy, sicker than you are,",OH

10266,"got lost on the Guadalupe, and slept on the bare grass in sheep camps for two",OH

10267,"weeks. Well, sir, it started him getting well, which he done. Close to the",OH

10268,ground--that's where the medicine in the air stays. Try a little hossback riding,OH

10269,"now. There's a gentle pony--""",OH

10270,"""What've I done to yer?"" screamed McGuire. ""Did I ever doublecross yer? Did",OH

10271,I ask you to bring me here? Drive me out to your camps if you wanter; or stick,OH

10272,a knife in me and save trouble. Ride! I can't lift my feet. I couldn't sidestep a,OH

10273,jab from a five-year-old kid. That's what your d--d ranch has done for me.,OH

10275,"Reubens who don't know a punching bag from a lobster salad.""",OH

10276,"""It's a lonesome place, for certain,"" apologised Raidler abashedly. ""We got",OH

10278,"up and fetch it down for you.""",OH

10281,"grapes for him thirty miles, and four out of his way, tied to his saddle-horn.",OH

10282,"After remaining in the smoke-tainted room for a while, he emerged and",OH

10283,bluntly confided his suspicions to Raidler.,OH

10284,"""His arm,"" said Chad, ""is harder'n a diamond. He interduced me to what he",OH

10285,"called a shore-perplexus punch, and 'twas like being kicked twice by a",OH

10286,"mustang. He's playin' it low down on you, Curt. He ain't no sicker'n I am. I",OH

10287,"hate to say it, but the runt's workin' you for range and shelter.""",OH

10288,"The cattleman's ingenuous mind refused to entertain Chad's view of the case,",OH

10289,"and when, later, he came to apply the test, doubt entered not into his motives.",OH

10290,"One day, about noon, two men drove up to the ranch, alighted, hitched, and",OH

10291,came in to dinner; standing and general invitations being the custom of the,OH

10292,"country. One of them was a great San Antonio doctor, whose costly services",OH

10293,had been engaged by a wealthy cowman who had been laid low by an,OH

10294,accidental bullet. He was now being driven back to the station to take the train,OH

10295,"back to town. After dinner Raidler took him aside, pushed a twenty-dollar bill",OH

10296,"against his hand, and said:",OH

10297,"""Doc, there's a young chap in that room I guess has got a bad case of",OH

10298,"consumption. I'd like for you to look him over and see just how bad he is, and",OH

10299,"if we can do anything for him.""",OH

10300,"""How much was that dinner I just ate, Mr. Raidler?"" said the doctor bluffly,",OH

10301,looking over his spectacles. Raidler returned the money to his pocket. The,OH

10302,"doctor immediately entered McGuire's room, and the cattleman seated himself",OH

10303,"upon a heap of saddles on the gallery, ready to reproach himself in the event",OH

10304,the verdict should be unfavourable.,OH

10305,"In ten minutes the doctor came briskly out. ""Your man,"" he said promptly, ""is",OH

10306,"as sound as a new dollar. His lungs are better than mine. Respiration,",OH

10307,"temperature, and pulse normal. Chest expansion four inches. Not a sign of",OH

10308,"weakness anywhere. Of course I didn't examine for the bacillus, but it isn't",OH

10309,there. You can put my name to the diagnosis. Even cigarettes and a vilely,OH

10310,"close room haven't hurt him. Coughs, does he? Well, you tell him it isn't",OH

10311,"necessary. You asked if there is anything we could do for him. Well, I advise",OH

10312,you to set him digging post-holes or breaking mustangs. There's our team,OH

10313,"ready. Good- day, sir."" And like a puff of wholesome, blustery wind the doctor",OH

10314,was off.,OH

10315,"Raidler reached out and plucked a leaf from a mesquite bush by the railing,",OH

10316,and began chewing it thoughtfully.,OH

10317,"The branding season was at hand, and the next morning Ross Hargis, foreman",OH

10318,"of the outfit, was mustering his force of some twenty-five men at the ranch,",OH

10319,"ready to start for the San Carlos range, where the work was to begin. By six",OH

10320,"o'clock the horses were all saddled, the grub wagon ready, and the cowpunchers were swinging themselves upon their mounts, when Raidler bade",OH

10321,"them wait. A boy was bringing up an extra pony, bridled and saddled, to the",OH

10322,gate. Raidler walked to McGuire's room and threw open the door. McGuire,OH

10323,"was lying on his cot, not yet dressed, smoking.",OH

10324,"""Get up,"" said the cattleman, and his voice was clear and brassy, like a bugle.",OH

10325,"""How's that?"" asked McGuire, a little startled.",OH

10326,"""Get up and dress. I can stand a rattlesnake, but I hate a liar. Do I have to tell",OH

10327,"you again?"" He caught McGuire by the neck and stood him on the floor.",OH

10328,"""Say, friend,"" cried McGuire wildly, ""are you bug-house? I'm sick-- see? I'll",OH

10329,"croak if I got to hustle. What've I done to yer?""--he began his chronic whine-""I never asked yer to--""",OH

10330,"""Put on your clothes,"" called Raidler in a rising tone.",OH

10331,"Swearing, stumbling, shivering, keeping his amazed, shining eyes upon the",OH

10332,"now menacing form of the aroused cattleman, McGuire managed to tumble",OH

10333,into his clothes. Then Raidler took him by the collar and shoved him out and,OH

10334,across the yard to the extra pony hitched at the gate. The cow-punchers lolled,OH

10335,"in their saddles, open-mouthed.",OH

10336,"""Take this man,"" said Raidler to Ross Hargis, ""and put him to work. Make him",OH

10337,"work hard, sleep hard, and eat hard. You boys know I done what I could for",OH

10338,"him, and he was welcome. Yesterday the best doctor in San Antone examined",OH

10339,"him, and says he's got the lungs of a burro and the constitution of a steer. You",OH

10340,"know what to do with him, Ross.""",OH

10341,Ross Hargis only smiled grimly.,OH

10342,"""Aw,"" said McGuire, looking intently at Raidler, with a peculiar expression",OH

10343,"upon his face, ""the croaker said I was all right, did he? Said I was fakin', did",OH

10344,"he? You put him onto me. You t'ought I wasn't sick. You said I was a liar. Say,",OH

10345,"friend, I talked rough, I know, but I didn't mean most of it. If you felt like I",OH

10346,"did--aw! I forgot--I ain't sick, the croaker says. Well, friend, now I'll go work",OH

10347,"for yer. Here's where you play even.""",OH

10348,"He sprang into the saddle easily as a bird, got the quirt from the horn, and gave",OH

10349,"his pony a slash with it. ""Cricket,"" who once brought in Good Boy by a neck",OH

10350,at Hawthorne--and a 10 to 1 shot--had his foot in the stirrups again.,OH

10351,"McGuire led the cavalcade as they dashed away for San Carlos, and the cowpunchers gave a yell of applause as they closed in behind his dust.",OH

10352,"But in less than a mile he had lagged to the rear, and was last man when they",OH

10353,struck the patch of high chaparral below the horse pens. Behind a clump of,OH

10354,"this he drew rein, and held a handkerchief to his mouth. He took it away",OH

10355,"drenched with bright, arterial blood, and threw it carefully into a clump of",OH

10356,"prickly pear. Then he slashed with his quirt again, gasped ""G'wan"" to his",OH

10357,"astonished pony, and galloped after the gang.",OH

10358,That night Raidler received a message from his old home in Alabama. There,OH

10359,"had been a death in the family; an estate was to divide, and they called for him",OH

10360,"to come. Daylight found him in the buckboard, skimming the prairies for the",OH

10361,station. It was two months before he returned. When he arrived at the ranch,OH

10362,"house he found it well-nigh deserted save for Ylario, who acted as a kind of",OH

10363,steward during his absence. Little by little the youth made him acquainted,OH

10364,"with the work done while he was away. The branding camp, he was informed,",OH

10365,was still doing business. On account of many severe storms the cattle had been,OH

10366,"badly scattered, and the branding had been accomplished but slowly. The",OH

10367,"camp was now in the valley of the Guadalupe, twenty miles away.",OH

10368,"""By the way,"" said Raidler, suddenly remembering, ""that fellow I sent along",OH

10369,"with them--McGuire--is he working yet?""",OH

10370,"""I do not know,"" said Ylario. ""Mans from the camp come verree few times to",OH

10372,"fellow McGuire he dead much time ago.""",OH

10373,"""Dead!"" said Raidler. ""What you talking about?""",OH

10375,"theenk he no live one, two month when he go away.""",OH

10376,"""Shucks!"" said Raidler. ""He humbugged you, too, did he? The doctor",OH

10377,"examined him and said he was sound as a mesquite knot.""",OH

10378,"""That doctor,"" said Ylario, smiling, ""he tell you so? That doctor no see",OH

10379,"McGuire.""",OH

10380,"""Talk up,"" ordered Raidler. ""What the devil do you mean?""",OH

10381,"""McGuire,"" continued the boy tranquilly, ""he getting drink water outside when",OH

10383,"with his fingers""--putting his hand to his chest--""I not know for what. He put",OH

10384,"his ear here and here and here, and listen-- I not know for what. He put little",OH

10385,glass stick in my mouth. He feel my arm here. He make me count like,OH

10386,"whisper--so--twenty, /treinta/, /cuarenta/. Who knows,"" concluded Ylario, with",OH

10387,"a deprecating spread of his hands, ""for what that doctor do those verree droll",OH

10388,"and such-like things?""",OH

10389,"""What horses are up?"" asked Raidler shortly.",OH

10390,"""Paisano is grazing out behind the little corral, /senor/.""",OH

10391,"""Saddle him for me at once.""",OH

10392,"Within a very few minutes the cattleman was mounted and away. Paisano, well",OH

10393,"named after that ungainly but swift-running bird, struck into his long lope that",OH

10394,"ate up the ground like a strip of macaroni. In two hours and a quarter Raidler,",OH

10395,"from a gentle swell, saw the branding camp by a water hole in the Guadalupe.",OH

10396,"Sick with expectancy of the news he feared, he rode up, dismounted, and",OH

10397,dropped Paisano's reins. So gentle was his heart that at that moment he would,OH

10398,have pleaded guilty to the murder of McGuire.,OH

10399,"The only being in the camp was the cook, who was just arranging the hunks of",OH

10400,"barbecued beef, and distributing the tin coffee cups for supper. Raidler evaded",OH

10401,a direct question concerning the one subject in his mind.,OH

10402,"""Everything all right in camp, Pete?"" he managed to inquire.",OH

10403,"""So, so,"" said Pete, conservatively. ""Grub give out twice. Wind scattered the",OH

10404,"cattle, and we've had to rake the brush for forty mile. I need a new coffee-pot.",OH

10405,"And the mosquitos is some more hellish than common.""",OH

10406,"""The boys--all well?""",OH

10407,"Pete was no optimist. Besides, inquiries concerning the health of cowpunchers were not only superfluous, but bordered on flaccidity. It was not like",OH

10408,the boss to make them.,OH

10409,"""What's left of 'em don't miss no calls to grub,"" the cook conceded.",OH

10410,"""What's left of 'em?"" repeated Raidler in a husky voice. Mechanically he",OH

10411,began to look around for McGuire's grave. He had in his mind a white slab,OH

10412,such as he had seen in the Alabama church-yard. But immediately he knew,OH

10413,that was foolish.,OH

10414,"""Sure,"" said Pete; ""what's left. Cow camps change in two months. Some's",OH

10415,"gone.""",OH

10416,Raidler nerved himself.,OH

10417,"""That--chap--I sent along--McGuire--did--he--""",OH

10418,"""Say,"" interrupted Pete, rising with a chunk of corn bread in each hand, ""that",OH

10419,"was a dirty shame, sending that poor, sick kid to a cow camp. A doctor that",OH

10421,"Game as he was, too--it's a scandal among snakes--lemme tell you what he",OH

10422,done. First night in camp the boys started to initiate him in the leather,OH

10424,"what do you reckon the poor child did? Got up, the little skeeter, and licked",OH

10425,Ross. Licked Ross Hargis. Licked him good. Hit him plenty and everywhere,OH

10428,and bleeds. A hem'ridge they calls it. He lays there eighteen hours by the,OH

10430,"can lick him, goes to work and damns the doctors from Greenland to Poland",OH

10461,AN AFTERNOON MIRACLE,OH

10462,"At the United States end of an international river bridge, four armed rangers",OH

10463,"sweltered in a little 'dobe hut, keeping a fairly faithful espionage upon the",OH

10464,lagging trail of passengers from the Mexican side.,OH

10465,"Bud Dawson, proprietor of the Top Notch Saloon, had, on the evening",OH

10466,"previous, violently ejected from his premises one Leandro Garcia, for alleged",OH

10467,"violation of the Top Notch code of behaviour. Garcia had mentioned twentyfour hours as a limit, by which time he would call and collect a painful",OH

10468,indemnity for personal satisfaction.,OH

10469,"This Mexican, although a tremendous braggart, was thoroughly courageous,",OH

10470,and each side of the river respected him for one of these attributes. He and a,OH

10471,following of similar bravoes were addicted to the pastime of retrieving towns,OH

10472,from stagnation.,OH

10473,The day designated by Garcia for retribution was to be further signalised on,OH

10474,"the American side by a cattlemen's convention, a bull fight, and an old settlers'",OH

10475,"barbecue and picnic. Knowing the avenger to be a man of his word, and",OH

10476,believing it prudent to court peace while three such gently social relaxations,OH

10477,"were in progress, Captain McNulty, of the ranger company stationed there,",OH

10478,detailed his lieutenant and three men for duty at the end of the bridge. Their,OH

10480,his gang.,OH

10481,"Travel was slight that sultry afternoon, and the rangers swore gently, and",OH

10482,mopped their brows in their convenient but close quarters. For an hour no one,OH

10483,had crossed save an old woman enveloped in a brown wrapper and a black,OH

10484,"mantilla, driving before her a burro loaded with kindling wood tied in small",OH

10485,"bundles for peddling. Then three shots were fired down the street, the sound",OH

10486,coming clear and snappy through the still air.,OH

10487,"The four rangers quickened from sprawling, symbolic figures of indolence to",OH

10488,"alert life, but only one rose to his feet. Three turned their eyes beseechingly",OH

10489,"but hopelessly upon the fourth, who had gotten nimbly up and was buckling",OH

10490,"his cartridge-belt around him. The three knew that Lieutenant Bob Buckley, in",OH

10491,"command, would allow no man of them the privilege of investigating a row",OH

10493,"The agile, broad-chested lieutenant, without a change of expression in his",OH

10494,"smooth, yellow-brown, melancholy face, shot the belt strap through the guard",OH

10495,"of the buckle, hefted his sixes in their holsters as a belle gives the finishing",OH

10496,"touches to her toilette, caught up his Winchester, and dived for the door. There",OH

10530,knowing that he was the most arrant physical coward in all that Rio Bravo,OH

10531,country! Neither his friends nor his enemies had suspected him of aught else,OH

10532,"than the finest courage. It was purely a physical cowardice, and only by an",OH

10533,"extreme, grim effort of will had he forced his craven body to do the bravest",OH

10534,"deeds. Scourging himself always, as a monk whips his besetting sin, Buckley",OH

10535,"threw himself with apparent recklessness into every danger, with the hope of",OH

10536,some day ridding himself of the despised affliction. But each successive test,OH

10537,"brought no relief, and the ranger's face, by nature adapted to cheerfulness and",OH

10538,"good-humour, became set to the guise of gloomy melancholy. Thus, while the",OH

10539,"frontier admired his deeds, and his prowess was celebrated in print and by",OH

10540,"word of mouth in many camp- fires in the valley of the Bravo, his heart was",OH

10541,"sick within him. Only himself knew of the horrible tightening of the chest, the",OH

10542,"dry mouth, the weakening of the spine, the agony of the strung nerves--the",OH

10543,never- failing symptoms of his shameful malady.,OH

10544,One mere boy in his company was wont to enter a fray with a leg perched,OH

10545,"flippantly about the horn of his saddle, a cigarette hanging from his lips, which",OH

10546,emitted smoke and original slogans of clever invention. Buckley would have,OH

10547,given a year's pay to attain that devil- may-care method. Once the debonair,OH

10548,"youth said to him: ""Buck, you go into a scrap like it was a funeral. Not,"" he",OH

10549,"added, with a complimentary wave of his tin cup, ""but what it generally is.""",OH

10550,Buckley's conscience was of the New England order with Western,OH

10551,"adjustments, and he continued to get his rebellious body into as many",OH

10552,"difficulties as possible; wherefore, on that sultry afternoon he chose to drive",OH

10553,his own protesting limbs to investigation of that sudden alarm that had startled,OH

10554,the peace and dignity of the State.,OH

10555,Two squares down the street stood the Top Notch Saloon. Here Buckley came,OH

10556,upon signs of recent upheaval. A few curious spectators pressed about its front,OH

10557,"entrance, grinding beneath their heels the fragments of a plate-glass window.",OH

10558,"Inside, Buckley found Bud Dawson utterly ignoring a bullet wound in his",OH

10559,"shoulder, while he feelingly wept at having to explain why he failed to drop",OH

10560,"the ""blamed masquerooter,"" who shot him. At the entrance of the ranger Bud",OH

10561,turned appealingly to him for confirmation of the devastation he might have,OH

10562,dealt.,OH

10563,"""You know, Buck, I'd 'a' plum got him, first rattle, if I'd thought a minute.",OH

10564,"Come in a-masque-rootin', playin' female till he got the drop, and turned loose.",OH

10565,"I never reached for a gun, thinkin' it was sure Chihuahua Betty, or Mrs.",OH

10566,"Atwater, or anyhow one of the Mayfield girls comin' a-gunnin', which they",OH

10567,"might, liable as not. I never thought of that blamed Garcia until--""",OH

10568,"""Garcia!"" snapped Buckley. ""How did he get over here?""",OH

10569,Bud's bartender took the ranger by the arm and led him to the side door. There,OH

10570,"stood a patient grey burro cropping the grass along the gutter, with a load of",OH

10571,kindling wood tied across its back. On the ground lay a black shawl and a,OH

10572,voluminous brown dress.,OH

10573,"""Masquerootin' in them things,"" called Bud, still resisting attempted",OH

10574,"ministrations to his wounds. ""Thought he was a lady till he gave a yell and",OH

10575,"winged me.""",OH

10576,"""He went down this side street,"" said the bartender. ""He was alone, and he'll",OH

10577,hide out till night when his gang comes over. You ought to find him in that,OH

10578,"Mexican lay-out below the depot. He's got a girl down there--Pancha Sales.""",OH

10579,"""How was he armed?"" asked Buckley.",OH

10580,"""Two pearl-handled sixes, and a knife.""",OH

10581,"""Keep this for me, Billy,"" said the ranger, handing over his Winchester.",OH

10582,"Quixotic, perhaps, but it was Bob Buckley's way. Another man--and a braver",OH

10583,one--might have raised a posse to accompany him. It was Buckley's rule to,OH

10584,discard all preliminary advantage.,OH

10585,"The Mexican had left behind him a wake of closed doors and an empty street,",OH

10586,but now people were beginning to emerge from their places of refuge with,OH

10587,assumed unconsciousness of anything having happened. Many citizens who,OH

10588,knew the ranger pointed out to him with alacrity the course of Garcia's retreat.,OH

10589,As Buckley swung along upon the trail he felt the beginning of the suffocating,OH

10590,"constriction about his throat, the cold sweat under the brim of his hat, the old,",OH

10591,"shameful, dreaded sinking of his heart as it went down, down, down in his",OH

10592,bosom.,OH

10593,"The morning train of the Mexican Central had that day been three hours late,",OH

10594,thus failing to connect with the I. & G.N. on the other side of the river.,OH

10595,Passengers for /Los Estados Unidos/ grumblingly sought entertainment in the,OH

10596,"little swaggering mongrel town of two nations, for, until the morrow, no other",OH

10597,"train would come to rescue them. Grumblingly, because two days later would",OH

10598,begin the great fair and races in San Antone. Consider that at that time San,OH

10599,"Antone was the hub of the wheel of Fortune, and the names of its spokes were",OH

10600,"Cattle, Wool, Faro, Running Horses, and Ozone. In those times cattlemen",OH

10601,"played at crack-loo on the sidewalks with double-eagles, and gentlemen",OH

10602,backed their conception of the fortuitous card with stacks limited in height,OH

10603,"only by the interference of gravity. Wherefore, thither journeyed the sowers",OH

10604,"and the reapers--they who stampeded the dollars, and they who rounded them",OH

10605,up. Especially did the caterers to the amusement of the people haste to San,OH

10606,"Antone. Two greatest shows on earth were already there, and dozens of",OH

10607,smallest ones were on the way.,OH

10608,"On a side track near the mean little 'dobe depot stood a private car, left there",OH

10609,by the Mexican train that morning and doomed by an ineffectual schedule to,OH

10610,"ignobly await, amid squalid surroundings, connection with the next day's",OH

10611,regular.,OH

10612,"The car had been once a common day-coach, but those who had sat in it and",OH

10613,gringed to the conductor's hat-band slips would never have recognised it in its,OH

10614,transformation. Paint and gilding and certain domestic touches had liberated it,OH

10615,from any suspicion of public servitude. The whitest of lace curtains,OH

10616,judiciously screened its windows. From its fore end drooped in the torrid air,OH

10617,the flag of Mexico. From its rear projected the Stars and Stripes and a busy,OH

10618,"stovepipe, the latter reinforcing in its suggestion of culinary comforts the",OH

10619,"general suggestion of privacy and ease. The beholder's eye, regarding its",OH

10620,"gorgeous sides, found interest to culminate in a single name in gold and blue",OH

10621,"letters extending almost its entire length--a single name, the audacious",OH

10622,"privilege of royalty and genius. Doubly, then, was this arrogant nomenclature",OH

10623,"here justified; for the name was that of ""Alvarita, Queen of the Serpent Tribe.""",OH

10624,"This, her car, was back from a triumphant tour of the principal Mexican cities,",OH

10625,"and now headed for San Antonio, where, according to promissory",OH

10631,"its architecture tent, /jacal/, and 'dobe; its distractions the hurdy-gurdy and the",OH

10632,informal contribution to the sudden stranger's store of experience. Beyond this,OH

10633,"dishonourable fringe upon the old town's jowl rose a dense mass of trees,",OH

10634,surmounting and filling a little hollow. Through this bickered a small stream,OH

10635,that perished down the sheer and disconcerting side of the great canon of the,OH

10636,Rio Bravo del Norte.,OH

10637,In this sordid spot was condemned to remain for certain hours the impotent,OH

10638,transport of the Queen of the Serpent Tribe.,OH

10639,The front door of the car was open. Its forward end was curtained off into a,OH

10640,small reception-room. Here the admiring and propitiatory reporters were wont,OH

10641,to sit and transpose the music of Senorita Alvarita's talk into the more florid,OH

10642,key of the press. A picture of Abraham Lincoln hung against a wall; one of a,OH

10643,cluster of school-girls grouped upon stone steps was in another place; a third,OH

10644,"was Easter lilies in a blood-red frame. A neat carpet was under foot. A pitcher,",OH

10645,"sweating cold drops, and a glass stood on a fragile stand. In a willow rocker,",OH

10646,"reading a newspaper, sat Alvarita.",OH

10647,"Spanish, you would say; Andalusian, or, better still, Basque; that compound,",OH

10648,"like the diamond, of darkness and fire. Hair, the shade of purple grapes viewed",OH

10649,"at midnight. Eyes, long, dusky, and disquieting with their untroubled",OH

10650,"directness of gaze. Face, haughty and bold, touched with a pretty insolence",OH

10651,"that gave it life. To hasten conviction of her charm, but glance at the stacks of",OH

10658,"A hand drew aside the curtain that partitioned the car, and a middle- aged,",OH

10659,faded woman holding a knife and a half-peeled potato looked in and said:,OH

10666,That there biggest snake's gone again. I've looked all over the car and can't,OH

10668,"rustlin' along the floor, but I thought it was you.""",OH

10669,"""Oh, blame that old rascal!"" exclaimed the Queen, throwing down her paper.",OH

10670,"""This is the third time he's got away. George never /will/ fasten down the lid to",OH

10678,"A few minutes later Alvarita stopped upon the forward platform, ready for her",OH

10679,quest. Her handsome black skirt was shaped to the most recent proclamation,OH

10680,of fashion. Her spotless shirt-waist gladdened the eye in that desert of,OH

10681,"sunshine, a swelling oasis, cool and fresh. A man's split-straw hat sat firmly on",OH

10682,"her coiled, abundant hair. Beneath her serene, round, impudent chin a man's",OH

10683,"four-in-hand tie was jauntily knotted about a man's high, stiff collar. A parasol",OH

10684,"she carried, of white silk, and its fringe was lace, yellowly genuine.",OH

10685,"I will grant Gallipolis as to her costume, but firmly to Seville or Valladolid I",OH

10687,escapades--all these their dark depths guaranteed.,OH

10688,"""Ain't you afraid to go out alone, Alviry?"" queried the Queen-mother",OH

10689,"anxiously. ""There's so many rough people about. Mebbe you'd better--""",OH

10690,"""I never saw anything I was afraid of yet, ma. 'Specially people. And men in",OH

10692,"scamp.""",OH

10693,The dust lay thick upon the bare ground near the tracks. Alvarita's eye soon,OH

10694,discovered the serrated trail of the escaped python. It led across the depot,OH

10695,"grounds and away down a smaller street in the direction of the little canon, as",OH

10696,predicted by her. A stillness and lack of excitement in the neighbourhood,OH

10697,"encouraged the hope that, as yet, the inhabitants were unaware that so",OH

10698,formidable a guest traversed their highways. The heat had driven them,OH

10699,"indoors, whence outdrifted occasional shrill laughs, or the depressing whine of",OH

10700,"a maltreated concertina. In the shade a few Mexican children, like vivified",OH

10701,"stolid idols in clay, stared from their play, vision-struck and silent, as Alvarita",OH

10702,"came and went. Here and there a woman peeped from a door and stood dumb,",OH

10703,reduced to silence by the aspect of the white silk parasol.,OH

10704,"A hundred yards and the limits of the town were passed, scattered chaparral",OH

10705,"succeeding, and then a noble grove, overflowing the bijou canon. Through this",OH

10706,"a small bright stream meandered. Park-like it was, with a kind of cockney",OH

10707,ruralness further endorsed by the waste papers and rifled tins of picnickers. Up,OH

10708,"this stream, and down it, among its pseudo-sylvan glades and depressions,",OH

10709,wandered the bright and unruffled Alvarita. Once she saw evidence of the,OH

10710,recreant reptile's progress in his distinctive trail across a spread of fine sand in,OH

10711,the arroyo. The living water was bound to lure him; he could not be far away.,OH

10712,So sure was she of his immediate proximity that she perched herself to idle for,OH

10713,a time in the curve of a great creeper that looped down from a giant water-elm.,OH

10714,To reach this she climbed from the pathway a little distance up the side of a,OH

10715,steep and rugged incline. Around her chaparral grew thick and high. A lateblooming ratama tree dispensed from its yellow petals a sweet and persistent,OH

10716,"odour. Adown the ravine rustled a seductive wind, melancholy with the taste",OH

10717,"of sodden, fallen leaves.",OH

10718,"Alvarita removed her hat, and undoing the oppressive convolutions of her hair,",OH

10719,"began to slowly arrange it in two long, dusky plaits.",OH

10720,"From the obscure depths of a thick clump of evergreen shrubs five feet away,",OH

10721,two small jewel-bright eyes were steadfastly regarding her. Coiled there lay,OH

10722,"Kuku, the great python; Kuku, the magnificent, he of the plated muzzle, the",OH

10723,"grooved lips, the eleven-foot stretch of elegantly and brilliantly mottled skin.",OH

10724,The great python was viewing his mistress without a sound or motion to,OH

10725,"disclose his presence. Perhaps the splendid truant forefelt his capture, but,",OH

10726,"screened by the foliage, thought to prolong the delight of his escapade. What",OH

10727,"pleasure it was, after the hot and dusty car, to lie thus, smelling the running",OH

10728,"water, and feeling the agreeable roughness of the earth and stones against his",OH

10729,"body! Soon, very soon the Queen would find him, and he, powerless as a",OH

10730,"worm in her audacious hands, would be returned to the dark chest in the",OH

10731,narrow house that ran on wheels.,OH

10732,Alvarita heard a sudden crunching of the gravel below her. Turning her head,OH

10733,"she saw a big, swarthy Mexican, with a daring and evil expression,",OH

10734,"contemplating her with an ominous, dull eye.",OH

10735,"""What do you want?"" she asked as sharply as five hairpins between her lips",OH

10736,"would permit, continuing to plait her hair, and looking him over with placid",OH

10737,"contempt. The Mexican continued to gaze at her, and showed his teeth in a",OH

10738,"white, jagged smile.",OH

10739,"""I no hurt-y you, Senorita,"" he said.",OH

10740,"""You bet you won't,"" answered the Queen, shaking back one finished, massive",OH

10741,"plait. ""But don't you think you'd better move on?""",OH

10742,"""Not hurt-y you--no. But maybeso take one /beso/--one li'l kees, you call him.""",OH

10743,"The man smiled again, and set his foot to ascend the slope. Alvarita leaned",OH

10744,swiftly and picked up a stone the size of a cocoanut.,OH

10745,"""Vamoose, quick,"" she ordered peremptorily, ""you /coon/!""",OH

10746,The red of insult burned through the Mexican's dark skin.,OH

10747,"""/Hidalgo, Yo/!"" he shot between his fangs. ""I am not neg-r-ro! /Diabla",OH

10748,"bonita/, for that you shall pay me.""",OH

10749,"He made two quick upward steps this time, but the stone, hurled by no weak",OH

10750,"arm, struck him square in the chest. He staggered back to the footway,",OH

10751,"swerved half around, and met another sight that drove all thoughts of the girl",OH

10752,from his head. She turned her eyes to see what had diverted his interest. A man,OH

10753,"with red-brown, curling hair and a melancholy, sunburned, smooth-shaven",OH

10754,"face was coming up the path, twenty yards away. Around the Mexican's waist",OH

10755,was buckled a pistol belt with two empty holsters. He had laid aside his sixes-possibly in the /jacal/ of the fair Pancha--and had forgotten them when the,OH

10756,passing of the fairer Alvarita had enticed him to her trail. His hands now flew,OH

10757,"instinctively to the holsters, but finding the weapons gone, he spread his",OH

10758,"fingers outward with the eloquent, abjuring, deprecating Latin gesture, and",OH

10759,"stood like a rock. Seeing his plight, the newcomer unbuckled his own belt",OH

10760,"containing two revolvers, threw it upon the ground, and continued to advance.",OH

10761,"""Splendid!"" murmured Alvarita, with flashing eyes.",OH

10762,"As Bob Buckley, according to the mad code of bravery that his sensitive",OH

10763,"conscience imposed upon his cowardly nerves, abandoned his guns and closed",OH

10764,"in upon his enemy, the old, inevitable nausea of abject fear wrung him. His",OH

10765,breath whistled through his constricted air passages. His feet seemed like,OH

10766,"lumps of lead. His mouth was dry as dust. His heart, congested with blood,",OH

10767,hurt his ribs as it thumped against them. The hot June day turned to moist,OH

10768,"November. And still he advanced, spurred by a mandatory pride that strained",OH

10769,its uttermost against his weakling flesh.,OH

10770,"The distance between the two men slowly lessened. The Mexican stood,",OH

10771,"immovable, waiting. When scarce five yards separated them a little shower of",OH

10772,loosened gravel rattled down from above to the ranger's feet. He glanced,OH

10773,"upward with instinctive caution. A pair of dark eyes, brilliantly soft, and fierily",OH

10774,"tender, encountered and held his own. The most fearful heart and the boldest",OH

10775,one in all the Rio Bravo country exchanged a silent and inscrutable,OH

10776,"communication. Alvarita, still seated within her vine, leaned forward above",OH

10777,the breast-high chaparral. One hand was laid across her bosom. One great dark,OH

10778,braid curved forward over her shoulder. Her lips were parted; her face was lit,OH

10779,with what seemed but wonder--great and absolute wonder. Her eyes lingered,OH

10780,upon Buckley's. Let no one ask or presume to tell through what subtle medium,OH

10781,the miracle was performed. As by a lightning flash two clouds will accomplish,OH

10782,"counterpoise and compensation of electric surcharge, so on that eyeglance the",OH

10783,"man received his complement of manhood, and the maid conceded what",OH

10784,enriched her womanly grace by its loss.,OH

10785,"The Mexican, suddenly stirring, ventilated his attitude of apathetic waiting by",OH

10786,"conjuring swiftly from his bootleg a long knife. Buckley cast aside his hat, and",OH

10787,"laughed once aloud, like a happy school-boy at a frolic. Then, empty-handed,",OH

10788,"he sprang nimbly, and Garcia met him without default.",OH

10789,So soon was the engagement ended that disappointment imposed upon the,OH

10790,"ranger's warlike ecstasy. Instead of dealing the traditional downward stroke,",OH

10791,the Mexican lunged straight with his knife. Buckley took the precarious,OH

10792,"chance, and caught his wrist, fair and firm. Then he delivered the good Saxon",OH

10793,"knock-out blow--always so pathetically disastrous to the fistless Latin races-and Garcia was down and out, with his head under a clump of prickly pears.",OH

10794,The ranger looked up again to the Queen of the Serpents.,OH

10795,Alvarita scrambled down to the path.,OH

10796,"""I'm mighty glad I happened along when I did,"" said the ranger.",OH

10797,"""He--he frightened me so!"" cooed Alvarita.",OH

10798,"They did not hear the long, low hiss of the python under the shrubs. Wiliest of",OH

10799,"the beasts, no doubt he was expressing the humiliation he felt at having so",OH

10800,long dwelt in subjection to this trembling and colouring mistress of his whom,OH

10801,he had deemed so strong and potent and fearsome.,OH

10802,Then came galloping to the spot the civic authorities; and to them the ranger,OH

10803,"awarded the prostrate disturber of the peace, whom they bore away limply",OH

10804,across the saddle of one of their mounts. But Buckley and Alvarita lingered.,OH

10805,"Slowly, slowly they walked. The ranger regained his belt of weapons. With a",OH

10820,man who had just dined at the Menger and was waiting for a friend who had,OH

10821,promised to pick him up in his motor car. Curly's histrionic powers were equal,OH

10822,to the impersonation; but his make-up was wanting.,OH

10823,"The bartender rounded the bar in a casual way, looking up at the ceiling as",OH

10824,"though he was pondering some intricate problem of kalsomining, and then fell",OH

10825,"upon Curly so suddenly that the roadster had no excuses ready. Irresistibly, but",OH

10826,"so composedly that it seemed almost absendmindedness on his part, the",OH

10827,"dispenser of drinks pushed Curly to the swinging doors and kicked him out,",OH

10828,with a nonchalance that almost amounted to sadness. That was the way of the,OH

10829,Southwest.,OH

10830,Curly arose from the gutter leisurely. He felt no anger or resentment toward,OH

10831,his ejector. Fifteen years of tramphood spent out of the twenty-two years of his,OH

10832,life had hardened the fibres of his spirit. The slings and arrows of outrageous,OH

10833,fortune fell blunted from the buckler of his armoured pride. With especial,OH

10834,resignation did he suffer contumely and injury at the hands of bartenders.,OH

10835,"Naturally, they were his enemies; and unnaturally, they were often his friends.",OH

10836,He had to take his chances with them. But he had not yet learned to estimate,OH

10837,"these cool, languid, Southwestern knights of the bungstarter, who had the",OH

10838,"manners of an Earl of Pawtucket, and who, when they disapproved of your",OH

10839,"presence, moved you with the silence and despatch of a chess automaton",OH

10840,advancing a pawn.,OH

10841,"Curly stood for a few moments in the narrow, mesquite-paved street. San",OH

10842,Antonio puzzled and disturbed him. Three days he had been a non- paying,OH

10843,"guest of the town, having dropped off there from a box car of an I. & G.N.",OH

10844,"freight, because Greaser Johnny had told him in Des Moines that the Alamo",OH

10845,"City was manna fallen, gathered, cooked, and served free with cream and",OH

10846,sugar. Curly had found the tip partly a good one. There was hospitality in,OH

10847,"plenty of a careless, liberal, irregular sort. But the town itself was a weight",OH

10848,"upon his spirits after his experience with the rushing, business-like,",OH

10849,"systematised cities of the North and East. Here he was often flung a dollar, but",OH

10850,too frequently a good-natured kick would follow it. Once a band of hilarious,OH

10851,cowboys had roped him on Military Plaza and dragged him across the black,OH

10852,soil until no respectable rag-bag would have stood sponsor for his clothes. The,OH

10853,"winding, doubling streets, leading nowhere, bewildered him. And then there",OH

10854,"was a little river, crooked as a pot-hook, that crawled through the middle of",OH

10855,"the town, crossed by a hundred little bridges so nearly alike that they got on",OH

10856,Curly's nerves. And the last bartender wore a number nine shoe.,OH

10857,The saloon stood on a corner. The hour was eight o'clock. Homefarers and,OH

10858,outgoers jostled Curly on the narrow stone sidewalk. Between the buildings to,OH

10859,his left he looked down a cleft that proclaimed itself another thoroughfare. The,OH

10860,alley was dark except for one patch of light. Where there was light there were,OH

10861,sure to be human beings. Where there were human beings after nightfall in,OH

10862,"San Antonio there might be food, and there was sure to be drink. So Curly",OH

10863,headed for the light.,OH

10864,The illumination came from Schwegel's Cafe. On the sidewalk in front of it,OH

10865,Curly picked up an old envelope. It might have contained a check for a,OH

10866,"million. It was empty; but the wanderer read the address, ""Mr. Otto",OH

10867,"Schwegel,"" and the name of the town and State. The postmark was Detroit.",OH

10868,Curly entered the saloon. And now in the light it could be perceived that he,OH

10869,bore the stamp of many years of vagabondage. He had none of the tidiness of,OH

10870,the calculating and shrewd professional tramp. His wardrobe represented the,OH

10871,cast-off specimens of half a dozen fashions and eras. Two factories had,OH

10872,combined their efforts in providing shoes for his feet. As you gazed at him,OH

10873,"there passed through your mind vague impressions of mummies, wax figures,",OH

10874,"Russian exiles, and men lost on desert islands. His face was covered almost to",OH

10875,"his eyes with a curly brown beard that he kept trimmed short with a pocketknife, and that had furnished him with his /nom de route/. Light-blue eyes, full",OH

10876,"of sullenness, fear, cunning, impudence, and fawning, witnessed the stress that",OH

10877,had been laid upon his soul.,OH

10878,"The saloon was small, and in its atmosphere the odours of meat and drink",OH

10879,struggled for the ascendancy. The pig and the cabbage wrestled with hydrogen,OH

10880,and oxygen. Behind the bar Schwegel laboured with an assistant whose,OH

10881,epidermal pores showed no signs of being obstructed. Hot weinerwurst and,OH

10882,sauerkraut were being served to purchasers of beer. Curly shuffled to the end,OH

10883,"of the bar, coughed hollowly, and told Schwegel that he was a Detroit cabinetmaker out of a job.",OH

10884,It followed as the night the day that he got his schooner and lunch.,OH

10885,"""Was you acquainted maybe with Heinrich Strauss in Detroit?"" asked",OH

10886,Schwegel.,OH

10887,"""Did I know Heinrich Strauss?"" repeated Curly, affectionately. ""Why, say, 'Bo,",OH

10888,I wish I had a dollar for every game of pinochle me and Heine has played on,OH

10889,"Sunday afternoons.""",OH

10890,More beer and a second plate of steaming food was set before the diplomat.,OH

10891,"And then Curly, knowing to a fluid-drachm how far a ""con"" game would go,",OH

10892,shuffled out into the unpromising street.,OH

10893,And now he began to perceive the inconveniences of this stony Southern,OH

10894,town. There was none of the outdoor gaiety and brilliancy and music that,OH

10895,"provided distraction even to the poorest in the cities of the North. Here, even",OH

10896,"so early, the gloomy, rock-walled houses were closed and barred against the",OH

10897,murky dampness of the night. The streets were mere fissures through which,OH

10898,flowed grey wreaths of river mist. As he walked he heard laughter and the,OH

10899,"chink of coin and chips behind darkened windows, and music coming from",OH

10900,every chink of wood and stone. But the diversions were selfish; the day of,OH

10901,popular pastimes had not yet come to San Antonio.,OH

10902,"But at length Curly, as he strayed, turned the sharp angle of another lost street",OH

10903,and came upon a rollicking band of stockmen from the outlying ranches,OH

10904,celebrating in the open in front of an ancient wooden hotel. One great roisterer,OH

10905,"from the sheep country who had just instigated a movement toward the bar,",OH

10906,swept Curly in like a stray goat with the rest of his flock. The princes of kine,OH

10907,"and wool hailed him as a new zoological discovery, and uproariously strove to",OH

10908,preserve him in the diluted alcohol of their compliments and regards.,OH

10909,An hour afterward Curly staggered from the hotel barroom dismissed by his,OH

10910,"fickle friends, whose interest in him had subsided as quickly as it had risen.",OH

10911,"Full--stoked with alcoholic fuel and cargoed with food, the only question",OH

10912,remaining to disturb him was that of shelter and bed.,OH

10913,"A drizzling, cold Texas rain had begun to fall--an endless, lazy, unintermittent",OH

10914,downfall that lowered the spirits of men and raised a reluctant steam from the,OH

10915,"warm stones of the streets and houses. Thus comes the ""norther"" dousing",OH

10916,gentle spring and amiable autumn with the chilling salutes and adieux of,OH

10917,coming and departing winter.,OH

10918,Curly followed his nose down the first tortuous street into which his,OH

10919,"irresponsible feet conducted him. At the lower end of it, on the bank of the",OH

10920,"serpentine stream, he perceived an open gate in a cemented rock wall. Inside",OH

10921,he saw camp fires and a row of low wooden sheds built against three sides of,OH

10922,the enclosing wall. He entered the enclosure. Under the sheds many horses,OH

10923,were champing at their oats and corn. Many wagons and buckboards stood,OH

10924,about with their teams' harness thrown carelessly upon the shafts and,OH

10925,"doubletrees. Curly recognised the place as a wagon-yard, such as is provided",OH

10926,by merchants for their out-of- town friends and customers. No one was in,OH

10927,sight. No doubt the drivers of those wagons were scattered about the town,OH

10928,"""seeing the elephant and hearing the owl."" In their haste to become patrons of",OH

10929,the town's dispensaries of mirth and good cheer the last ones to depart must,OH

10930,have left the great wooden gate swinging open.,OH

10931,"Curly had satisfied the hunger of an anaconda and the thirst of a camel, so he",OH

10932,was neither in the mood nor the condition of an explorer. He zigzagged his,OH

10933,way to the first wagon that his eyesight distinguished in the semi-darkness,OH

10934,under the shed. It was a two-horse wagon with a top of white canvas. The,OH

10935,"wagon was half filled with loose piles of wool sacks, two or three great",OH

10936,"bundles of grey blankets, and a number of bales, bundles, and boxes. A",OH

10937,"reasoning eye would have estimated the load at once as ranch supplies, bound",OH

10938,on the morrow for some outlying hacienda. But to the drowsy intelligence of,OH

10939,Curly they represented only warmth and softness and protection against the,OH

10940,"cold humidity of the night. After several unlucky efforts, at last he conquered",OH

10941,gravity so far as to climb over a wheel and pitch forward upon the best and,OH

10942,warmest bed he had fallen upon in many a day. Then he became instinctively a,OH

10943,"burrowing animal, and dug his way like a prairie-dog down among the sacks",OH

10944,"and blankets, hiding himself from the cold air as snug and safe as a bear in his",OH

10945,den. For three nights sleep had visited Curly only in broken and shivering,OH

10946,"doses. So now, when Morpheus condescended to pay him a call, Curly got",OH

10947,such a strangle hold on the mythological old gentleman that it was a wonder,OH

10948,that anyone else in the whole world got a wink of sleep that night.,OH

10949,Six cowpunchers of the Cibolo Ranch were waiting around the door of the,OH

10950,"ranch store. Their ponies cropped grass near by, tied in the Texas fashion-which is not tied at all. Their bridle reins had been dropped to the earth, which",OH

10951,is a more effectual way of securing them (such is the power of habit and,OH

10952,imagination) than you could devise out of a half-inch rope and a live-oak tree.,OH

10953,"These guardians of the cow lounged about, each with a brown cigarette paper",OH

10954,"in his hand, and gently but unceasingly cursed Sam Revell, the storekeeper.",OH

10955,"Sam stood in the door, snapping the red elastic bands on his pink madras",OH

10956,shirtsleeves and looking down affectionately at the only pair of tan shoes,OH

10957,"within a forty-mile radius. His offence had been serious, and he was divided",OH

10958,between humble apology and admiration for the beauty of his raiment. He had,OH

10959,"allowed the ranch stock of ""smoking"" to become exhausted.",OH

10960,"""I thought sure there was another case of it under the counter, boys,"" he",OH

10961,"explained. ""But it happened to be catterdges.""",OH

10962,"""You've sure got a case of happenedicitis,"" said Poky Rodgers, fency rider of",OH

10963,"the Largo Verde /potrero/. ""Somebody ought to happen to give you a knock on",OH

10964,the head with the butt end of a quirt. I've rode in nine miles for some tobacco;,OH

10965,"and it don't appear natural and seemly that you ought to be allowed to live.""",OH

10966,"""The boys was smokin' cut plug and dried mesquite leaves mixed when I left,""",OH

10967,"sighed Mustang Taylor, horse wrangler of the Three Elm camp. ""They'll be",OH

10968,"lookin' for me back by nine. They'll be settin' up, with their papers ready to",OH

10969,roll a whiff of the real thing before bedtime. And I've got to tell 'em that this,OH

10970,"pink-eyed, sheep-headed, sulphur- footed, shirt-waisted son of a calico",OH

10971,"broncho, Sam Revell, hasn't got no tobacco on hand.""",OH

10972,"Gregorio Falcon, Mexican vaquero and best thrower of the rope on the Cibolo,",OH

10973,"pushed his heavy, silver-embroidered straw sombrero back upon his thicket of",OH

10974,"jet black curls, and scraped the bottoms of his pockets for a few crumbs of the",OH

10975,precious weed.,OH

10976,"""Ah, Don Samuel,"" he said, reproachfully, but with his touch of Castilian",OH

10977,"manners, ""escuse me. Dthey say dthe jackrabbeet and dthe sheep have dthe",OH

10978,"most leetle /sesos/--how you call dthem--brain-es? Ah don't believe dthat, Don",OH

10980,"dthey--bot you weel escuse me, Don Samuel.""",OH

10981,"""Now, what's the use of chewin' the rag, boys,"" said the untroubled Sam,",OH

10982,stooping over to rub the toes of his shoes with a red-and-yellow handkerchief.,OH

10983,"""Ranse took the order for some more smokin' to San Antone with him",OH

10984,Tuesday. Pancho rode Ranse's hoss back yesterday; and Ranse is goin' to drive,OH

10985,the wagon back himself. There wa'n't much of a load--just some woolsacks,OH

10986,and blankets and nails and canned peaches and a few things we was out of. I,OH

10987,look for Ranse to roll in to-day sure. He's an early starter and a hell-to-split,OH

10988,"driver, and he ought to be here not far from sundown.""",OH

10989,"""What plugs is he drivin'?"" asked Mustang Taylor, with a smack of hope in his",OH

10990,tones.,OH

10991,"""The buckboard greys,"" said Sam.",OH

10992,"""I'll wait a spell, then,"" said the wrangler. ""Them plugs eat up a trail like a",OH

10993,road-runner swallowin' a whip snake. And you may bust me open a can of,OH

10994,"greengage plums, Sam, while I'm waitin' for somethin' better.""",OH

10995,"""Open me some yellow clings,"" ordered Poky Rodgers. ""I'll wait, too.""",OH

10996,The tobaccoless punchers arranged themselves comfortably on the steps of the,OH

10997,store. Inside Sam chopped open with a hatchet the tops of the cans of fruit.,OH

10998,"The store, a big, white wooden building like a barn, stood fifty yards from the",OH

10999,ranch-house. Beyond it were the horse corrals; and still farther the wool sheds,OH

11000,and the brush-topped shearing pens--for the Rancho Cibolo raised both cattle,OH

11001,"and sheep. Behind the store, at a little distance, were the grass-thatched /jacals/",OH

11002,of the Mexicans who bestowed their allegiance upon the Cibolo.,OH

11003,"The ranch-house was composed of four large rooms, with plastered adobe",OH

11004,"walls, and a two-room wooden ell. A twenty-feet-wide ""gallery"" circumvented",OH

11005,the structure. It was set in a grove of immense live-oaks and water-elms near a,OH

11006,"lake--a long, not very wide, and tremendously deep lake in which at nightfall,",OH

11007,great gars leaped to the surface and plunged with the noise of hippopotamuses,OH

11008,frolicking at their bath. From the trees hung garlands and massive pendants of,OH

11009,"the melancholy grey moss of the South. Indeed, the Cibolo ranch-house",OH

11010,"seemed more of the South than of the West. It looked as if old ""Kiowa""",OH

11011,Truesdell might have brought it with him from the lowlands of Mississippi,OH

11012,when he came to Texas with his rifle in the hollow of his arm in '55.,OH

11013,"But, though he did not bring the family mansion, Truesdell did bring",OH

11014,something in the way of a family inheritance that was more lasting than brick,OH

11015,or stone. He brought one end of the Truesdell-Curtis family feud. And when a,OH

11016,"Curtis bought the Rancho de los Olmos, sixteen miles from the Cibolo, there",OH

11017,were lively times on the pear flats and in the chaparral thickets off the,OH

11018,Southwest. In those days Truesdell cleaned the brush of many a wolf and tiger,OH

11019,cat and Mexican lion; and one or two Curtises fell heirs to notches on his rifle,OH

11020,stock. Also he buried a brother with a Curtis bullet in him on the bank of the,OH

11021,lake at Cibolo. And then the Kiowa Indians made their last raid upon the,OH

11022,"ranches between the Frio and the Rio Grande, and Truesdell at the head of his",OH

11023,"rangers rid the earth of them to the last brave, earning his sobriquet. Then",OH

11024,came prosperity in the form of waxing herds and broadening lands. And then,OH

11025,"old age and bitterness, when he sat, with his great mane of hair as white as the",OH

11026,"Spanish-dagger blossoms and his fierce, pale-blue eyes, on the shaded gallery",OH

11027,"at Cibolo, growling like the pumas that he had slain. He snapped his fingers at",OH

11028,old age; the bitter taste to life did not come from that. The cup that stuck at his,OH

11029,"lips was that his only son Ransom wanted to marry a Curtis, the last youthful",OH

11030,survivor of the other end of the feud.,OH

11031,For a while the only sounds to be heard at the store were the rattling of the tin,OH

11032,"spoons and the gurgling intake of the juicy fruits by the cowpunchers, the",OH

11033,"stamping of the grazing ponies, and the singing of a doleful song by Sam as he",OH

11034,contentedly brushed his stiff auburn hair for the twentieth time that day before,OH

11035,a crinkly mirror.,OH

11036,"From the door of the store could be seen the irregular, sloping stretch of prairie",OH

11037,"to the south, with its reaches of light-green, billowy mesquite flats in the lower",OH

11038,"places, and its rises crowned with nearly black masses of short chaparral.",OH

11039,"Through the mesquite flat wound the ranch road that, five miles away, flowed",OH

11040,into the old government trail to San Antonio. The sun was so low that the,OH

11041,gentlest elevation cast its grey shadow miles into the green-gold sea of,OH

11042,sunshine.,OH

11043,That evening ears were quicker than eyes.,OH

11044,The Mexican held up a tawny finger to still the scraping of tin against tin.,OH

11053,Two miles away they saw a faint cloud dimming the green ripples of the,OH

11054,mesquites. In twenty minutes they heard the clatter of the horses' hoofs: in five,OH

11055,"minutes more the grey plugs dashed out of the thicket, whickering for oats and",OH

11056,drawing the light wagon behind them like a toy.,OH

11057,"From the /jacals/ came a cry of: ""El Amo! El Amo!"" Four Mexican youths",OH

11064,After striking dry country Ranse had removed the wagon sheet from the bows,OH

11065,and thrown it over the goods in the wagon. Six pair of hasty hands dragged it,OH

11066,off and grabbled beneath the sacks and blankets for the cases of tobacco.,OH

11067,"Long Collins, tobacco messenger from the San Gabriel outfit, who rode with",OH

11068,"the longest stirrups west of the Mississippi, delved with an arm like the tongue",OH

11071,"twine. From its ragged end, like the head and claws of a disturbed turtle,",OH

11072,protruded human toes.,OH

11075,"Up from his long slumber popped Curly, like some vile worm from its burrow.",OH

11076,"He clawed his way out and sat blinking like a disreputable, drunken owl. His",OH

11077,face was as bluish-red and puffed and seamed and cross-lined as the cheapest,OH

11091,"""Drag him out, Collins,"" said Ranse.",OH

11092,Curly took a slide and felt the ground rise up and collide with his shoulder,OH

11094,"nerves, hugging his knees and sneering. Taylor lifted out a case of tobacco and",OH

11095,"wrenched off its top. Six cigarettes began to glow, bringing peace and",OH

11096,forgiveness to Sam.,OH

11097,"""How'd you come in my wagon?"" repeated Ranse, this time in a voice that",OH

11098,drew a reply.,OH

11099,Curly recognised the tone. He had heard it used by freight brakemen and large,OH

11123,Ranse saw that the tramp's nerves were racking him. He despatched one of the,OH

11125,"and into his eyes came a brief, grateful glow--as human as the expression in",OH

11126,the eye of a faithful setter dog.,OH

11177,Eight miles east of the Cibolo ranch-house Ranse loosened the pressure of his,OH

11179,blossoms showered fragrance that would have undone the roses of France. The,OH

11180,moon made the earth a great concave bowl with a crystal sky for a lid. In a,OH

11181,glade five jack-rabbits leaped and played together like kittens. Eight miles,OH

11191,"the ratamas, and the admirable figure of Ranse Truesdell, the lover. But she",OH

11192,"was there, eight miles from her home, to meet him.",OH

11217,opened the lowest drawer of an old bureau to get out the packet of letters that,OH

11218,Yenna had written him one summer when she had gone to Mississippi for a,OH

11219,"visit. The drawer stuck, and he yanked at it savagely--as a man will. It came",OH

11220,"out of the bureau, and bruised both his shins--as a drawer will. An old, folded",OH

11221,yellow letter without an envelope fell from somewhere--probably from where,OH

11222,it had lodged in one of the upper drawers. Ranse took it to the lamp and read it,OH

11223,curiously.,OH

11224,Then he took his hat and walked to one of the Mexican /jacals/.,OH

11240,An hour Ranse spent behind Tia Juana's closed door. As he was on his way,OH

11242,"The tramp sat on his cot, swinging his feet and smoking.",OH

11247,"""Stand up out here in the light,"" said Ranse, looking at him closely.",OH

11248,Curly got up sullenly and took a step or two.,OH

11249,"His face, now shaven smooth, seemed transformed. His hair had been combed,",OH

11250,and it fell back from the right side of his forehead with a peculiar wave. The,OH

11251,"moonlight charitably softened the ravages of drink; and his aquiline, wellshaped nose and small, square cleft chin almost gave distinction to his looks.",OH

11285,Curly was sitting on his blankets in the San Gabriel camp cursing talentedly,OH

11286,when Ranse Truesdell rode up and dismounted on the next afternoon. The,OH

11302,"""Run away, farmer,"" said Curly, sardonically. ""Willie will send for nursey",OH

11304,"The /charco/, or water hole, was twelve yards away. Ranse took one of Curly's",OH

11308,Curly crawled out and up the bank spluttering like a porpoise.,OH

11309,Ranse met him with a piece of soap and a coarse towel in his hands.,OH

11311,"some dry clothes at the wagon.""",OH

11312,The tramp obeyed without protest. By the time supper was ready he had,OH

11313,returned to camp. He was hardly to be recognised in his new shirt and brown,OH

11315,"""Lordy, I hope he ain't a coward,"" he was saying to himself. ""I hope he won't",OH

11316,"turn out to be a coward.""",OH

11317,His doubts were soon allayed. Curly walked straight to where he stood. His,OH

11319,"""Now I'm clean,"" he said meaningly, ""maybe you'll talk to me. Think you've",OH

11322,"that?""",OH

11323,Curly planted a stinging slap against Ranse's left cheek. The print of his hand,OH

11324,stood out a dull red against the tan.,OH

11325,Ranse smiled happily.,OH

11326,The cowpunchers talk to this day of the battle that followed.,OH

11327,Somewhere in his restless tour of the cities Curly had acquired the art of selfdefence. The ranchman was equipped only with the splendid strength and,OH

11328,equilibrium of perfect health and the endurance conferred by decent living.,OH

11329,The two attributes nearly matched. There were no formal rounds. At last the,OH

11330,fibre of the clean liver prevailed. The last time Curly went down from one of,OH

11331,"the ranchman's awkward but powerful blows he remained on the grass, but",OH

11332,looking up with an unquenched eye.,OH

11333,Ranse went to the water barrel and washed the red from a cut on his chin in,OH

11334,the stream from the faucet.,OH

11335,On his face was a grin of satisfaction.,OH

11336,Much benefit might accrue to educators and moralists if they could know the,OH

11337,details of the curriculum of reclamation through which Ranse put his waif,OH

11338,during the month that he spent in the San Gabriel camp. The ranchman had no,OH

11339,fine theories to work out--perhaps his whole stock of pedagogy embraced only,OH

11340,a knowledge of horse-breaking and a belief in heredity.,OH

11341,The cowpunchers saw that their boss was trying to make a man out of the,OH

11342,strange animal that he had sent among them; and they tacitly organised,OH

11343,themselves into a faculty of assistants. But their system was their own.,OH

11344,Curly's first lesson stuck. He became on friendly and then on intimate terms,OH

11345,with soap and water. And the thing that pleased Ranse most was that his,OH

11346,"""subject"" held his ground at each successive higher step. But the steps were",OH

11347,sometimes far apart.,OH

11348,Once he got at the quart bottle of whisky kept sacredly in the grub tent for,OH

11349,"rattlesnake bites, and spent sixteen hours on the grass, magnificently drunk.",OH

11350,But when he staggered to his feet his first move was to find his soap and towel,OH

11351,"and start for the /charco/. And once, when a treat came from the ranch in the",OH

11352,"form of a basket of fresh tomatoes and young onions, Curly devoured the",OH

11353,entire consignment before the punchers reached the camp at supper time.,OH

11354,And then the punchers punished him in their own way. For three days they did,OH

11355,"not speak to him, except to reply to his own questions or remarks. And they",OH

11356,spoke with absolute and unfailing politeness. They played tricks on one,OH

11357,another; they pounded one another hurtfully and affectionately; they heaped,OH

11358,upon one another's heads friendly curses and obloquy; but they were polite to,OH

11359,"Curly. He saw it, and it stung him as much as Ranse hoped it would.",OH

11360,"Then came a night that brought a cold, wet norther. Wilson, the youngest of",OH

11361,"the outfit, had lain in camp two days, ill with fever. When Joe got up at",OH

11362,daylight to begin breakfast he found Curly sitting asleep against a wheel of the,OH

11366,Then the other punchers rose up softly and began to make preparations. Ranse,OH

11368,their six-shooters.,OH

11369,"""Boys,"" said Ranse, ""I'm much obliged. I was hoping you would. But I didn't",OH

11371,Half a dozen six-shooters began to pop--awful yells rent the air--Long Collins,OH

11372,"galloped wildly across Curly's bed, dragging the saddle after him. That was",OH

11373,merely their way of gently awaking their victim. Then they hazed him for an,OH

11374,"hour, carefully and ridiculously, after the code of cow camps. Whenever he",OH

11375,uttered protest they held him stretched over a roll of blankets and thrashed him,OH

11376,woefully with a pair of leather leggings.,OH

11377,"And all this meant that Curly had won his spurs, that he was receiving the",OH

11378,puncher's accolade. Nevermore would they be polite to him. But he would be,OH

11379,"their ""pardner"" and stirrup-brother, foot to foot.",OH

11380,When the fooling was ended all hands made a raid on Joe's big coffee- pot by,OH

11381,the fire for a Java nightcap. Ranse watched the new knight carefully to see if,OH

11382,he understood and was worthy. Curly limped with his cup of coffee to a log,OH

11383,and sat upon it. Long Collins followed and sat by his side. Buck Rabb went,OH

11384,and sat at the other. Curly--grinned.,OH

11385,"And then Ranse furnished Curly with mounts and saddle and equipment, and",OH

11386,"turned him over to Buck Rabb, instructing him to finish the job.",OH

11387,"Three weeks later Ranse rode from the ranch into Rabb's camp, which was",OH

11388,then in Snake Valley. The boys were saddling for the day's ride. He sought out,OH

11389,Long Collins among them.,OH

11390,"""How about that bronco?"" he asked.",OH

11391,Long Collins grinned.,OH

11392,"""Reach out your hand, Ranse Truesdell,"" he said, ""and you'll touch him. And",OH

11393,"you can shake his'n, too, if you like, for he's plumb white and there's none",OH

11394,"better in no camp.""",OH

11395,"Ranse looked again at the clear-faced, bronzed, smiling cowpuncher who",OH

11396,"stood at Collins's side. Could that be Curly? He held out his hand, and Curly",OH

11397,grasped it with the muscles of a bronco-buster.,OH

11398,"""I want you at the ranch,"" said Ranse.",OH

11399,"""All right, sport,"" said Curly, heartily. ""But I want to come back again. Say,",OH

11400,"pal, this is a dandy farm. And I don't want any better fun than hustlin' cows",OH

11401,"with this bunch of guys. They're all to the merry- merry.""",OH

11402,At the Cibolo ranch-house they dismounted. Ranse bade Curly wait at the door,OH

11404,table.,OH

11405,"""Good-morning, Mr. Truesdell,"" said Ranse.",OH

11406,The old man turned his white head quickly.,OH

11407,"""How is this?"" he began. ""Why do you call me 'Mr.--'?""",OH

11408,"When he looked at Ranse's face he stopped, and the hand that held his",OH

11409,newspaper shook slightly.,OH

11410,"""Boy,"" he said slowly, ""how did you find it out?""",OH

11411,"""It's all right,"" said Ranse, with a smile. ""I made Tia Juana tell me. It was kind",OH

11412,"of by accident, but it's all right.""",OH

11413,"""You've been like a son to me,"" said old ""Kiowa,"" trembling.",OH

11414,"""Tia Juana told me all about it,"" said Ranse. ""She told me how you adopted me",OH

11415,when I was knee-high to a puddle duck out of a wagon train of prospectors,OH

11416,"that was bound West. And she told me how the kid--your own kid, you know-got lost or was run away with. And she said it was the same day that the",OH

11418,"""Our boy strayed from the house when he was two years old,"" said the old",OH

11423,and beckoning.,OH

11424,Curly walked in.,OH

11425,No one could have doubted. The old man and the young had the same sweep,OH

11426,"of hair, the same nose, chin, line of face, and prominent light- blue eyes.",OH

11427,"Old ""Kiowa"" rose eagerly.",OH

11428,Curly looked about the room curiously. A puzzled expression came over his,OH

11440,is what you're out of. She wants more of a thing when it's scarce. She likes to,OH

11441,have souvenirs of things that never happened. She likes to be reminded of,OH

11442,things she never heard of. A one-sided view of objects is disjointing to the,OH

11443,female composition.,OH

11444,"""'Tis a misfortune of mine, begotten by nature and travel,"" continued Jeff,",OH

11445,"looking thoughtfully between his elevated feet at the grocery stove, ""to look",OH

11446,deeper into some subjects than most people do. I've breathed gasoline smoke,OH

11447,talking to street crowds in nearly every town in the United States. I've held 'em,OH

11448,"spellbound with music, oratory, sleight of hand, and prevarications, while I've",OH

11449,"sold 'em jewelry, medicine, soap, hair tonic, and junk of other nominations.",OH

11450,"And during my travels, as a matter of recreation and expiation, I've taken",OH

11451,cognisance some of women. It takes a man a lifetime to find out about one,OH

11452,"particular woman; but if he puts in, say, ten years, industrious and curious, he",OH

11453,can acquire the general rudiments of the sex. One lesson I picked up was when,OH

11454,I was working the West with a line of Brazilian diamonds and a patent fire,OH

11455,kindler just after my trip from Savannah down through the cotton belt with,OH

11456,Dalby's Anti-explosive Lamp Oil Powder. 'Twas when the Oklahoma country,OH

11457,was in first bloom. Guthrie was rising in the middle of it like a lump of selfraising dough. It was a boom town of the regular kind--you stood in line to get,OH

11458,a chance to wash your face; if you ate over ten minutes you had a lodging bill,OH

11459,added on; if you slept on a plank at night they charged it to you as board the,OH

11460,next morning.,OH

11461,"""By nature and doctrines I am addicted to the habit of discovering choice",OH

11462,places wherein to feed. So I looked around and found a proposition that,OH

11463,exactly cut the mustard. I found a restaurant tent just opened up by an outfit,OH

11464,that had drifted in on the tail of the boom. They had knocked together a box,OH

11465,"house, where they lived and did the cooking, and served the meals in a tent",OH

11466,pitched against the side. That tent was joyful with placards on it calculated to,OH

11467,redeem the world-worn pilgrim from the sinfulness of boarding houses and,OH

11468,"pick-me- up hotels. 'Try Mother's Home-Made Biscuits,' 'What's the Matter",OH

11469,with Our Apple Dumplings and Hard Sauce?' 'Hot Cakes and Maple Syrup,OH

11470,"Like You Ate When a Boy,' 'Our Fried Chicken Never Was Heard to Crow'-there was literature doomed to please the digestions of man! I said to myself",OH

11471,that mother's wandering boy should munch there that night. And so it came to,OH

11472,pass. And there is where I contracted my case of Mame Dugan.,OH

11473,"""Old Man Dugan was six feet by one of Indiana loafer, and he spent his time",OH

11474,sitting on his shoulder blades in a rocking-chair in the shanty memorialising,OH

11475,"the great corn-crop failure of '96. Ma Dugan did the cooking, and Mame",OH

11476,waited on the table.,OH

11477,"""As soon as I saw Mame I knew there was a mistake in the census reports.",OH

11478,There wasn't but one girl in the United States. When you come to,OH

11479,"specifications it isn't easy. She was about the size of an angel, and she had",OH

11480,"eyes, and ways about her. When you come to the kind of a girl she was, you'll",OH

11481,find a belt of 'em reaching from the Brooklyn Bridge west as far as the,OH

11482,"courthouse in Council Bluffs, Ia. They earn their own living in stores,",OH

11483,"restaurants, factories, and offices. They're chummy and honest and free and",OH

11484,"tender and sassy, and they look life straight in the eye. They've met man face",OH

11485,"to face, and discovered that he's a poor creature. They've dropped to it that the",OH

11486,reports in the Seaside Library about his being a fairy prince lack confirmation.,OH

11487,"""Mame was that sort. She was full of life and fun, and breezy; she passed the",OH

11488,repartee with the boarders quick as a wink; you'd have smothered laughing. I,OH

11489,am disinclined to make excavations into the insides of a personal affection. I,OH

11490,am glued to the theory that the diversions and discrepancies of the,OH

11491,indisposition known as love should be as private a sentiment as a toothbrush.,OH

11492,'Tis my opinion that the biographies of the heart should be confined with the,OH

11494,you'll excuse the lack of an itemised bill of my feelings toward Mame.,OH

11495,"""Pretty soon I got a regular habit of dropping into the tent to eat at irregular",OH

11498,"mealtime? Want to see how much trouble you can be, of course.",OH

11499,Friedchickenbeefsteakporkchopshamandeggspotpie'--and so on. She called me,OH

11500,"Jeff, but there was no significations attached. Designations was all she meant.",OH

11501,The front names of any of us she used as they came to hand. I'd eat about two,OH

11502,"meals before I left, and string 'em out like a society spread where they changed",OH

11503,"plates and wives, and josh one another festively between bites. Mame stood",OH

11504,"for it, pleasant, for it wasn't up to her to take any canvas off the tent by",OH

11505,declining dollars just because they were whipped in after meal times.,OH

11506,"""It wasn't long until there was another fellow named Ed Collier got the",OH

11509,and Mame's turn as waiter a continuous performance. That Collier man was,OH

11510,saturated with designs and contrivings. He was in well-boring or insurance or,OH

11511,"claim-jumping, or something--I've forgotten which. He was a man well",OH

11512,"lubricated with gentility, and his words were such as recommended you to his",OH

11513,"point of view. So, Collier and me infested the grub tent with care and activity.",OH

11514,Mame was level full of impartiality. 'Twas like a casino hand the way she dealt,OH

11516,card up her sleeve.,OH

11517,"""Me and Collier naturally got acquainted, and gravitated together some on the",OH

11780,"mornings. There is always a time, in my business, when the star of success",OH

11781,"says, 'Move on to the next town.' I was travelling by wagon at that time so as",OH

11782,not to miss any of the small towns; so I hitched up a few days later and went,OH

11783,down to tell Mame good-bye. I wasn't abandoning the game; I intended,OH

11784,running over to Oklahoma City and work it for a week or two. Then I was,OH

11785,coming back to institute fresh proceedings against Mame.,OH

11786,"""What do I find at the Dugans' but Mame all conspicuous in a blue travelling",OH

11788,"typewriter in Terre Haute, is going to be married next Thursday, and Mame is",OH

11789,off for a week's visit to be an accomplice at the ceremony. Mame is waiting for,OH

11791,"freight wagon with promptness and scorn, and offers to deliver the goods",OH

11792,"myself. Ma Dugan sees no reason why not, as Mr. Freighter wants pay for the",OH

11793,"job; so, thirty minutes later Mame and I pull out in my light spring wagon with",OH

11794,"white canvas cover, and head due south.",OH

11795,"""That morning was of a praiseworthy sort. The breeze was lively, and smelled",OH

11796,"excellent of flowers and grass, and the little cottontail rabbits entertained",OH

11797,themselves with skylarking across the road. My two Kentucky bays went for,OH

11798,the horizon until it come sailing in so fast you wanted to dodge it like a,OH

11799,clothesline. Mame was full of talk and rattled on like a kid about her old home,OH

11800,and her school pranks and the things she liked and the hateful ways of those,OH

11801,"Johnson girls just across the street, 'way up in Indiana. Not a word was said",OH

11802,about Ed Collier or victuals or such solemn subjects. About noon Mame looks,OH

11803,and finds that the lunch she had put up in a basket had been left behind. I,OH

11804,"could have managed quite a collation, but Mame didn't seem to be grieving",OH

11805,"over nothing to eat, so I made no lamentations. It was a sore subject with me,",OH

11806,and I ruled provender in all its branches out of my conversation.,OH

11807,"""I am minded to touch light on explanations how I came to lose the way. The",OH

11808,road was dim and well grown with grass; and there was Mame by my side,OH

11809,"confiscating my intellects and attention. The excuses are good or they are not,",OH

11810,"as they may appear to you. But I lost it, and at dusk that afternoon, when we",OH

11811,"should have been in Oklahoma City, we were seesawing along the edge of",OH

11812,"nowhere in some undiscovered river bottom, and the rain was falling in large,",OH

11813,wet bunches. Down there in the swamps we saw a little log house on a small,OH

11814,knoll of high ground. The bottom grass and the chaparral and the lonesome,OH

11815,"timber crowded all around it. It seemed to be a melancholy little house, and",OH

11816,"you felt sorry for it. 'Twas that house for the night, the way I reasoned it. I",OH

11817,"explained to Mame, and she leaves it to me to decide. She doesn't become",OH

11818,"galvanic and prosecuting, as most women would, but she says it's all right; she",OH

11819,knows I didn't mean to do it.,OH

11820,"""We found the house was deserted. It had two empty rooms. There was a little",OH

11821,shed in the yard where beasts had once been kept. In a loft of it was a lot of,OH

11822,"old hay. I put my horses in there and gave them some of it, for which they",OH

11823,"looked at me sorrowful, expecting apologies. The rest of the hay I carried into",OH

11824,"the house by armfuls, with a view to accommodations. I also brought in the",OH

11825,"patent kindler and the Brazilians, neither of which are guaranteed against the",OH

11826,action of water.,OH

11827,"""Mame and I sat on the wagon seats on the floor, and I lit a lot of the kindler",OH

11828,"on the hearth, for the night was chilly. If I was any judge, that girl enjoyed it.",OH

11829,It was a change for her. It gave her a different point of view. She laughed and,OH

11830,"talked, and the kindler made a dim light compared to her eyes. I had a",OH

11831,"pocketful of cigars, and as far as I was concerned there had never been any fall",OH

11832,of man. We were at the same old stand in the Garden of Eden. Out there,OH

11833,"somewhere in the rain and the dark was the river of Zion, and the angel with",OH

11834,the flaming sword had not yet put up the keep-off-the-grass sign. I opened up,OH

11835,"a gross or two of the Brazilians and made Mame put them on--rings, brooches,",OH

11836,"necklaces, eardrops, bracelets, girdles, and lockets. She flashed and sparkled",OH

11837,like a million-dollar princess until she had pink spots in her cheeks and almost,OH

11838,cried for a looking-glass.,OH

11839,"""When it got late I made a fine bunk on the floor for Mame with the hay and",OH

11840,"my lap robes and blankets out of the wagon, and persuaded her to lie down. I",OH

11841,sat in the other room burning tobacco and listening to the pouring rain and,OH

11842,meditating on the many vicissitudes that came to a man during the seventy,OH

11843,years or so immediately preceding his funeral.,OH

11844,"""I must have dozed a little while before morning, for my eyes were shut, and",OH

11845,"when I opened them it was daylight, and there stood Mame with her hair all",OH

11846,"done up neat and correct, and her eyes bright with admiration of existence.",OH

11847,"""'Gee whiz, Jeff!' she exclaims, 'but I'm hungry. I could eat a--'",OH

11848,"""I looked up and caught her eye. Her smile went back in and she gave me a",OH

11849,"cold look of suspicion. Then I laughed, and laid down on the floor to laugh",OH

11850,"easier. It seemed funny to me. By nature and geniality I am a hearty laugher,",OH

11851,"and I went the limit. When I came to, Mame was sitting with her back to me,",OH

11852,all contaminated with dignity.,OH

11853,"""'Don't be angry, Mame,' I says, 'for I couldn't help it. It's the funny way",OH

11854,you've done up your hair. If you could only see it!',OH

11855,"""'You needn't tell stories, sir,' said Mame, cool and advised. 'My hair is all",OH

11856,"right. I know what you were laughing about. Why, Jeff, look outside,' she",OH

11857,"winds up, peeping through a chink between the logs. I opened the little",OH

11858,"wooden window and looked out. The entire river bottom was flooded, and the",OH

11859,knob of land on which the house stood was an island in the middle of a,OH

11860,rushing stream of yellow water a hundred yards wide. And it was still raining,OH

11861,hard. All we could do was to stay there till the doves brought in the olive,OH

11862,branch.,OH

11863,"""I am bound to admit that conversations and amusements languished during",OH

11864,that day. I was aware that Mame was getting a too prolonged one-sided view,OH

11865,"of things again, but I had no way to change it. Personally, I was wrapped up in",OH

11866,"the desire to eat. I had hallucinations of hash and visions of ham, and I kept",OH

11867,"saying to myself all the time, 'What'll you have to eat, Jeff?--what'll you order",OH

11868,"now, old man, when the waiter comes?' I picks out to myself all sorts of",OH

11869,"favourites from the bill of fare, and imagines them coming. I guess it's that",OH

11870,way with all hungry men. They can't get their cogitations trained on anything,OH

11871,but something to eat. It shows that the little table with the broken-legged caster,OH

11872,and the imitation Worcester sauce and the napkin covering up the coffee stains,OH

11873,"is the paramount issue, after all, instead of the question of immortality or",OH

11874,peace between nations.,OH

11875,"""I sat there, musing along, arguing with myself quite heated as to how I'd have",OH

11876,"my steak--with mushrooms, or /a la creole/. Mame was on the other seat,",OH

11877,"pensive, her head leaning on her hand. 'Let the potatoes come home-fried,' I",OH

11878,"states in my mind, 'and brown the hash in the pan, with nine poached eggs on",OH

11879,"the side.' I felt, careful, in my own pockets to see if I could find a peanut or a",OH

11880,grain or two of popcorn.,OH

11881,"""Night came on again with the river still rising and the rain still falling. I",OH

11882,looked at Mame and I noticed that desperate look on her face that a girl always,OH

11883,wears when she passes an ice-cream lair. I knew that poor girl was hungry-maybe for the first time in her life. There was that anxious look in her eye that,OH

11884,a woman has only when she has missed a meal or feels her skirt coming,OH

11885,unfastened in the back.,OH

11886,"""It was about eleven o'clock or so on the second night when we sat, gloomy, in",OH

11887,"our shipwrecked cabin. I kept jerking my mind away from the subject of food,",OH

11888,but it kept flopping back again before I could fasten it. I thought of everything,OH

11889,good to eat I had ever heard of. I went away back to my kidhood and,OH

11890,remembered the hot biscuit sopped in sorghum and bacon gravy with partiality,OH

11891,"and respect. Then I trailed along up the years, pausing at green apples and salt,",OH

11892,"flapjacks and maple, lye hominy, fried chicken Old Virginia style, corn on the",OH

11893,"cob, spareribs and sweet potato pie, and wound up with Georgia Brunswick",OH

11961,love of it--because he was quick-tempered-- to avoid arrest--for his own,OH

11962,amusement--any reason that came to his mind would suffice. He had escaped,OH

11963,capture because he could shoot five-sixths of a second sooner than any sheriff,OH

11995,"Far more than the law, the Mexicans dreaded the cold and certain vengeance",OH

11998,"Terpsichorean feats, simply that he might be entertained, what terrible and",OH

12007,"don't keer to say, myself. I'm two seconds later in pulling a gun than I used to",OH

12008,"be, and the difference is worth thinking about. But this Kid's got a halfMexican girl at the Crossing that he comes to see. She lives in that /jacal/ a",OH

12011,"Sandridge rode down to the /jacal/ of Perez. The sun was low, and the broad",OH

12012,shade of the great pear thicket already covered the grass- thatched hut. The,OH

12013,goats were enclosed for the night in a brush corral near by. A few kids walked,OH

12014,"the top of it, nibbling the chaparral leaves. The old Mexican lay upon a blanket",OH

12015,"on the grass, already in a stupor from his mescal, and dreaming, perhaps, of",OH

12016,the nights when he and Pizarro touched glasses to their New World fortunes-so old his wrinkled face seemed to proclaim him to be. And in the door of the,OH

12017,/jacal/ stood Tonia. And Lieutenant Sandridge sat in his saddle staring at her,OH

12018,like a gannet agape at a sailorman.,OH

12019,"The Cisco Kid was a vain person, as all eminent and successful assassins are,",OH

12020,and his bosom would have been ruffled had he known that at a simple,OH

12021,"exchange of glances two persons, in whose minds he had been looming large,",OH

12022,suddenly abandoned (at least for the time) all thought of him.,OH

12023,Never before had Tonia seen such a man as this. He seemed to be made of,OH

12024,sunshine and blood-red tissue and clear weather. He seemed to illuminate the,OH

12025,"shadow of the pear when he smiled, as though the sun were rising again. The",OH

12026,"men she had known had been small and dark. Even the Kid, in spite of his",OH

12027,"achievements, was a stripling no larger than herself, with black, straight hair",OH

12028,"and a cold, marble face that chilled the noonday.",OH

12029,"As for Tonia, though she sends description to the poorhouse, let her make a",OH

12030,"millionaire of your fancy. Her blue-black hair, smoothly divided in the middle",OH

12031,"and bound close to her head, and her large eyes full of the Latin melancholy,",OH

12032,gave her the Madonna touch. Her motions and air spoke of the concealed fire,OH

12033,and the desire to charm that she had inherited from the /gitanas/ of the Basque,OH

12034,"province. As for the humming-bird part of her, that dwelt in her heart; you",OH

12035,could not perceive it unless her bright red skirt and dark blue blouse gave you,OH

12036,a symbolic hint of the vagarious bird.,OH

12037,The newly lighted sun-god asked for a drink of water. Tonia brought it from,OH

12038,the red jar hanging under the brush shelter. Sandridge considered it necessary,OH

12039,to dismount so as to lessen the trouble of her ministrations.,OH

12040,I play no spy; nor do I assume to master the thoughts of any human heart; but I,OH

12041,"assert, by the chronicler's right, that before a quarter of an hour had sped,",OH

12042,"Sandridge was teaching her how to plaint a six-strand rawhide stake-rope, and",OH

12043,Tonia had explained to him that were it not for her little English book that the,OH

12044,"peripatetic /padre/ had given her and the little crippled /chivo/, that she fed",OH

12045,"from a bottle, she would be very, very lonely indeed.",OH

12046,"Which leads to a suspicion that the Kid's fences needed repairing, and that the",OH

12047,adjutant-general's sarcasm had fallen upon unproductive soil.,OH

12048,In his camp by the water hole Lieutenant Sandridge announced and reiterated,OH

12049,his intention of either causing the Cisco Kid to nibble the black loam of the,OH

12050,Frio country prairies or of haling him before a judge and jury. That sounded,OH

12051,business-like. Twice a week he rode over to the Lone Wolf Crossing of the,OH

12052,"Frio, and directed Tonia's slim, slightly lemon-tinted fingers among the",OH

12053,intricacies of the slowly growing lariata. A six-strand plait is hard to learn and,OH

12054,easy to teach.,OH

12055,The ranger knew that he might find the Kid there at any visit. He kept his,OH

12056,"armament ready, and had a frequent eye for the pear thicket at the rear of the",OH

12057,/jacal/. Thus he might bring down the kite and the humming-bird with one,OH

12058,stone.,OH

12059,While the sunny-haired ornithologist was pursuing his studies the Cisco Kid,OH

12060,was also attending to his professional duties. He moodily shot up a saloon in a,OH

12061,"small cow village on Quintana Creek, killed the town marshal (plugging him",OH

12062,"neatly in the centre of his tin badge), and then rode away, morose and",OH

12063,unsatisfied. No true artist is uplifted by shooting an aged man carrying an oldstyle .38 bulldog.,OH

12064,On his way the Kid suddenly experienced the yearning that all men feel when,OH

12065,wrong-doing loses its keen edge of delight. He yearned for the woman he,OH

12066,loved to reassure him that she was his in spite of it. He wanted her to call his,OH

12067,bloodthirstiness bravery and his cruelty devotion. He wanted Tonia to bring,OH

12068,"him water from the red jar under the brush shelter, and tell him how the",OH

12069,/chivo/ was thriving on the bottle.,OH

12070,The Kid turned the speckled roan's head up the ten-mile pear flat that stretches,OH

12071,along the Arroyo Hondo until it ends at the Lone Wolf Crossing of the Frio.,OH

12072,The roan whickered; for he had a sense of locality and direction equal to that,OH

12073,of a belt-line street-car horse; and he knew he would soon be nibbling the rich,OH

12074,mesquite grass at the end of a forty-foot stake-rope while Ulysses rested his,OH

12075,head in Circe's straw-roofed hut.,OH

12076,More weird and lonesome than the journey of an Amazonian explorer is the,OH

12077,ride of one through a Texas pear flat. With dismal monotony and startling,OH

12078,"variety the uncanny and multiform shapes of the cacti lift their twisted trunks,",OH

12079,"and fat, bristly hands to encumber the way. The demon plant, appearing to live",OH

12080,"without soil or rain, seems to taunt the parched traveller with its lush grey",OH

12081,greenness. It warps itself a thousand times about what look to be open and,OH

12082,"inviting paths, only to lure the rider into blind and impassable spine-defended",OH

12083,"""bottoms of the bag,"" leaving him to retreat, if he can, with the points of the",OH

12084,compass whirling in his head.,OH

12086,pierced by nails and with grotesque shapes of all the fiends hovering about.,OH

12088,"tracing the most fantastic and bewildering trail ever picked out, the good roan",OH

12089,lessened the distance to the Lone Wolf Crossing with every coil and turn that,OH

12090,he made.,OH

12091,"While they fared the Kid sang. He knew but one tune and sang it, as he knew",OH

12092,"but one code and lived it, and but one girl and loved her. He was a singleminded man of conventional ideas. He had a voice like a coyote with",OH

12093,"bronchitis, but whenever he chose to sing his song he sang it. It was a",OH

12094,"conventional song of the camps and trail, running at its beginning as near as",OH

12095,may be to these words:,OH

12096,Don't you monkey with my Lulu girl,OH

12097,"Or I'll tell you what I'll do-and so on. The roan was inured to it, and did not mind.",OH

12098,"But even the poorest singer will, after a certain time, gain his own consent to",OH

12099,"refrain from contributing to the world's noises. So the Kid, by the time he was",OH

12100,"within a mile or two of Tonia's /jacal/, had reluctantly allowed his song to die",OH

12101,away--not because his vocal performance had become less charming to his,OH

12102,"own ears, but because his laryngeal muscles were aweary.",OH

12103,As though he were in a circus ring the speckled roan wheeled and danced,OH

12104,through the labyrinth of pear until at length his rider knew by certain,OH

12105,"landmarks that the Lone Wolf Crossing was close at hand. Then, where the",OH

12106,"pear was thinner, he caught sight of the grass roof of the /jacal/ and the",OH

12107,hackberry tree on the edge of the arroyo. A few yards farther the Kid stopped,OH

12108,"the roan and gazed intently through the prickly openings. Then he dismounted,",OH

12109,"dropped the roan's reins, and proceeded on foot, stooping and silent, like an",OH

12110,"Indian. The roan, knowing his part, stood still, making no sound.",OH

12111,The Kid crept noiselessly to the very edge of the pear thicket and reconnoitred,OH

12112,between the leaves of a clump of cactus.,OH

12113,"Ten yards from his hiding-place, in the shade of the /jacal/, sat his Tonia",OH

12115,"women have been known, from time to time, to engage in more mischievous",OH

12116,"occupations. But if all must be told, there is to be added that her head reposed",OH

12117,"against the broad and comfortable chest of a tall red-and-yellow man, and that",OH

12118,"his arm was about her, guiding her nimble fingers that required so many",OH

12119,lessons at the intricate six- strand plait.,OH

12120,Sandridge glanced quickly at the dark mass of pear when he heard a slight,OH

12121,squeaking sound that was not altogether unfamiliar. A gun- scabbard will,OH

12122,make that sound when one grasps the handle of a six- shooter suddenly. But,OH

12123,the sound was not repeated; and Tonia's fingers needed close attention.,OH

12124,"And then, in the shadow of death, they began to talk of their love; and in the",OH

12125,still July afternoon every word they uttered reached the ears of the Kid.,OH

12126,"""Remember, then,"" said Tonia, ""you must not come again until I send for you.",OH

12127,Soon he will be here. A /vaquero/ at the /tienda/ said to-day he saw him on the,OH

12130,"until I send you the word.""",OH

12131,"""All right,"" said the stranger. ""And then what?""",OH

12138,"and give him no chance to escape.""",OH

12139,"""You used to think right much of him,"" said Sandridge.",OH

12150,"upon him. By Gregorio will the letter come. And bring many men with thee,",OH

12151,"and have much care, oh, dear red one, for the rattlesnake is not quicker to",OH

12153,"""The Kid's handy with his gun, sure enough,"" admitted Sandridge, ""but when I",OH

12154,come for him I shall come alone. I'll get him by myself or not at all. The Cap,OH

12155,wrote one or two things to me that make me want to do the trick without any,OH

12157,"""I will send you the message by the boy Gregorio,"" said the girl. ""I knew you",OH

12162,the earth for a parting salute. The drowsy stillness of the torpid summer air,OH

12163,still lay thick upon the dreaming afternoon. The smoke from the fire in the,OH

12164,"/jacal/, where the /frijoles/ blubbered in the iron pot, rose straight as a plumbline above the clay-daubed chimney. No sound or movement disturbed the",OH

12165,serenity of the dense pear thicket ten yards away.,OH

12166,"When the form of Sandridge had disappeared, loping his big dun down the",OH

12167,"steep banks of the Frio crossing, the Kid crept back to his own horse, mounted",OH

12168,"him, and rode back along the tortuous trail he had come.",OH

12169,But not far. He stopped and waited in the silent depths of the pear until half an,OH

12170,"hour had passed. And then Tonia heard the high, untrue notes of his unmusical",OH

12171,singing coming nearer and nearer; and she ran to the edge of the pear to meet,OH

12172,him.,OH

12173,The Kid seldom smiled; but he smiled and waved his hat when he saw her. He,OH

12174,"dismounted, and his girl sprang into his arms. The Kid looked at her fondly.",OH

12175,"His thick, black hair clung to his head like a wrinkled mat. The meeting",OH

12176,"brought a slight ripple of some undercurrent of feeling to his smooth, dark face",OH

12177,that was usually as motionless as a clay mask.,OH

12178,"""How's my girl?"" he asked, holding her close.",OH

12179,"""Sick of waiting so long for you, dear one,"" she answered. ""My eyes are dim",OH

12180,with always gazing into that devil's pincushion through which you come. And,OH

12181,"I can see into it such a little way, too. But you are here, beloved one, and I will",OH

12182,not scold. /Que mal muchacho/! not to come to see your /alma/ more often. Go,OH

12183,"in and rest, and let me water your horse and stake him with the long rope.",OH

12184,"There is cool water in the jar for you.""",OH

12185,The Kid kissed her affectionately.,OH

12186,"""Not if the court knows itself do I let a lady stake my horse for me,"" said he.",OH

12187,"""But if you'll run in, /chica/, and throw a pot of coffee together while I attend",OH

12188,"to the /caballo/, I'll be a good deal obliged.""",OH

12189,Besides his marksmanship the Kid had another attribute for which he admired,OH

12190,"himself greatly. He was /muy caballero/, as the Mexicans express it, where the",OH

12191,ladies were concerned. For them he had always gentle words and,OH

12192,consideration. He could not have spoken a harsh word to a woman. He might,OH

12193,"ruthlessly slay their husbands and brothers, but he could not have laid the",OH

12194,weight of a finger in anger upon a woman. Wherefore many of that interesting,OH

12195,division of humanity who had come under the spell of his politeness declared,OH

12196,their disbelief in the stories circulated about Mr. Kid. One shouldn't believe,OH

12197,"everything one heard, they said. When confronted by their indignant men folk",OH

12198,"with proof of the /caballero's/ deeds of infamy, they said maybe he had been",OH

12199,"driven to it, and that he knew how to treat a lady, anyhow.",OH

12200,Considering this extremely courteous idiosyncrasy of the Kid and the pride he,OH

12201,"took in it, one can perceive that the solution of the problem that was presented",OH

12202,to him by what he saw and heard from his hiding- place in the pear that,OH

12203,afternoon (at least as to one of the actors) must have been obscured by,OH

12204,difficulties. And yet one could not think of the Kid overlooking little matters,OH

12205,of that kind.,OH

12206,"At the end of the short twilight they gathered around a supper of /frijoles/, goat",OH

12207,"steaks, canned peaches, and coffee, by the light of a lantern in the /jacal/.",OH

12208,"Afterward, the ancestor, his flock corralled, smoked a cigarette and became a",OH

12209,mummy in a grey blanket. Tonia washed the few dishes while the Kid dried,OH

12210,them with the flour-sacking towel. Her eyes shone; she chatted volubly of the,OH

12211,inconsequent happenings of her small world since the Kid's last visit; it was as,OH

12212,all his other home-comings had been.,OH

12213,Then outside Tonia swung in a grass hammock with her guitar and sang sad,OH

12214,/canciones de amor/.,OH

12215,"""Do you love me just the same, old girl?"" asked the Kid, hunting for his",OH

12216,cigarette papers.,OH

12217,"""Always the same, little one,"" said Tonia, her dark eyes lingering upon him.",OH

12218,"""I must go over to Fink's,"" said the Kid, rising, ""for some tobacco. I thought I",OH

12219,"had another sack in my coat. I'll be back in a quarter of an hour.""",OH

12220,"""Hasten,"" said Tonia, ""and tell me--how long shall I call you my own this",OH

12221,"time? Will you be gone again to-morrow, leaving me to grieve, or will you be",OH

12222,"longer with your Tonia?""",OH

12223,"""Oh, I might stay two or three days this trip,"" said the Kid, yawning. ""I've been",OH

12224,"on the dodge for a month, and I'd like to rest up.""",OH

12225,He was gone half an hour for his tobacco. When he returned Tonia was still,OH

12226,lying in the hammock.,OH

12227,"""It's funny,"" said the Kid, ""how I feel. I feel like there was somebody lying",OH

12228,behind every bush and tree waiting to shoot me. I never had mullygrubs like,OH

12229,them before. Maybe it's one of them presumptions. I've got half a notion to,OH

12230,light out in the morning before day. The Guadalupe country is burning up,OH

12231,"about that old Dutchman I plugged down there.""",OH

12232,"""You are not afraid--no one could make my brave little one fear.""",OH

12233,"""Well, I haven't been usually regarded as a jack-rabbit when it comes to",OH

12234,scrapping; but I don't want a posse smoking me out when I'm in your /jacal/.,OH

12235,"Somebody might get hurt that oughtn't to.""",OH

12236,"""Remain with your Tonia; no one will find you here.""",OH

12237,The Kid looked keenly into the shadows up and down the arroyo and toward,OH

12238,the dim lights of the Mexican village.,OH

12239,"""I'll see how it looks later on,"" was his decision.",OH

12240,"At midnight a horseman rode into the rangers' camp, blazing his way by noisy",OH

12241,"""halloes"" to indicate a pacific mission. Sandridge and one or two others turned",OH

12242,"out to investigate the row. The rider announced himself to be Domingo Sales,",OH

12243,"from the Lone Wolf Crossing. he bore a letter for Senor Sandridge. Old Luisa,",OH

12244,"the /lavendera/, had persuaded him to bring it, he said, her son Gregorio being",OH

12245,too ill of a fever to ride.,OH

12246,Sandridge lighted the camp lantern and read the letter. These were its words:,OH

12247,/Dear One/: He has come. Hardly had you ridden away when he came,OH

12248,out of the pear. When he first talked he said he would stay three,OH

12249,"days or more. Then as it grew later he was like a wolf or a fox,",OH

12250,"and walked about without rest, looking and listening. Soon he said",OH

12251,he must leave before daylight when it is dark and stillest. And,OH

12252,then he seemed to suspect that I be not true to him. He looked at,OH

12253,me so strange that I am frightened. I swear to him that I love,OH

12254,"him, his own Tonia. Last of all he said I must prove to him I am",OH

12255,true. He thinks that even now men are waiting to kill him as he,OH

12256,rides from my house. To escape he says he will dress in my,OH

12257,"clothes, my red skirt and the blue waist I wear and the brown",OH

12258,"mantilla over the head, and thus ride away. But before that he",OH

12259,"says that I must put on his clothes, his /pantalones/ and /camisa/",OH

12260,"and hat, and ride away on his horse from the /jacal/ as far as the",OH

12261,"big road beyond the crossing and back again. This before he goes,",OH

12262,so he can tell if I am true and if men are hidden to shoot him. It,OH

12263,"is a terrible thing. An hour before daybreak this is to be. Come,",OH

12264,"my dear one, and kill this man and take me for your Tonia. Do not",OH

12265,"try to take hold of him alive, but kill him quickly. Knowing all,",OH

12266,you should do that. You must come long before the time and hide,OH

12267,yourself in the little shed near the /jacal/ where the wagon and,OH

12268,saddles are kept. It is dark in there. He will wear my red skirt,OH

12269,and blue waist and brown mantilla. I send you a hundred kisses.,OH

12270,Come surely and shoot quickly and straight.,OH

12271,Thine Own Tonia.,OH

12272,Sandridge quickly explained to his men the official part of the missive. The,OH

12273,rangers protested against his going alone.,OH

12274,"""I'll get him easy enough,"" said the lieutenant. ""The girl's got him trapped.",OH

12275,"And don't even think he'll get the drop on me.""",OH

12276,Sandridge saddled his horse and rode to the Lone Wolf Crossing. He tied his,OH

12277,"big dun in a clump of brush on the arroyo, took his Winchester from its",OH

12278,"scabbard, and carefully approached the Perez /jacal/. There was only the half",OH

12279,"of a high moon drifted over by ragged, milk-white gulf clouds.",OH

12280,The wagon-shed was an excellent place for ambush; and the ranger got inside,OH

12281,it safely. In the black shadow of the brush shelter in front of the /jacal/ he,OH

12282,could see a horse tied and hear him impatiently pawing the hard-trodden earth.,OH

12283,"He waited almost an hour before two figures came out of the /jacal/. One, in",OH

12284,"man's clothes, quickly mounted the horse and galloped past the wagon-shed",OH

12285,"toward the crossing and village. And then the other figure, in skirt, waist, and",OH

12286,"mantilla over its head, stepped out into the faint moonlight, gazing after the",OH

12287,rider. Sandridge thought he would take his chance then before Tonia rode,OH

12288,back. He fancied she might not care to see it.,OH

12289,"""Throw up your hands,"" he ordered loudly, stepping out of the wagon- shed",OH

12290,with his Winchester at his shoulder.,OH

12291,"There was a quick turn of the figure, but no movement to obey, so the ranger",OH

12292,pumped in the bullets--one--two--three--and then twice more; for you never,OH

12293,could be too sure of bringing down the Cisco Kid. There was no danger of,OH

12294,"missing at ten paces, even in that half moonlight.",OH

12295,"The old ancestor, asleep on his blanket, was awakened by the shots. Listening",OH

12296,"further, he heard a great cry from some man in mortal distress or anguish, and",OH

12297,rose up grumbling at the disturbing ways of moderns.,OH

12298,"The tall, red ghost of a man burst into the /jacal/, reaching one hand, shaking",OH

12299,"like a /tule/ reed, for the lantern hanging on its nail. The other spread a letter",OH

12300,on the table.,OH

12301,"""Look at this letter, Perez,"" cried the man. ""Who wrote it?""",OH

12302,"""/Ah, Dios/! it is Senor Sandridge,"" mumbled the old man, approaching.",OH

12303,"""/Pues, senor/, that letter was written by '/El Chivato/,' as he is called--by the",OH

12304,man of Tonia. They say he is a bad man; I do not know. While Tonia slept he,OH

12305,wrote the letter and sent it by this old hand of mine to Domingo Sales to be,OH

12306,brought to you. Is there anything wrong in the letter? I am very old; and I did,OH

12307,not know. /Valgame Dios/! it is a very foolish world; and there is nothing in,OH

12308,"the house to drink-- nothing to drink.""",OH

12309,Just then all that Sandridge could think of to do was to go outside and throw,OH

12310,"himself face downward in the dust by the side of his humming-bird, of whom",OH

12311,"not a feather fluttered. He was not a /caballero/ by instinct, and he could not",OH

12312,understand the niceties of revenge.,OH

12313,"A mile away the rider who had ridden past the wagon-shed struck up a harsh,",OH

12314,"untuneful song, the words of which began:",OH

12318,THE SPHINX APPLE,OH

12319,"Twenty miles out from Paradise, and fifteen miles short of Sunrise City,",OH

12320,"Bildad Rose, the stage-driver, stopped his team. A furious snow had been",OH

12321,"falling all day. Eight inches it measured now, on a level. The remainder of the",OH

12322,"road was not without peril in daylight, creeping along the ribs of a bijou range",OH

12323,"of ragged mountains. Now, when both snow and night masked its dangers,",OH

12324,"further travel was not to be thought of, said Bildad Rose. So he pulled up his",OH

12325,"four stout horses, and delivered to his five passengers oral deductions of his",OH

12326,wisdom.,OH

12327,"Judge Menefee, to whom men granted leadership and the initiatory as upon a",OH

12328,"silver salver, sprang from the coach at once. Four of his fellow-passengers",OH

12329,"followed, inspired by his example, ready to explore, to objurgate, to resist, to",OH

12330,"submit, to proceed, according as their prime factor might be inclined to sway",OH

12331,"them. The fifth passenger, a young woman, remained in the coach.",OH

12332,"Bildad had halted upon the shoulder of the first mountain spur. Two railfences, ragged-black, hemmed the road. Fifty yards above the upper fence,",OH

12333,"showing a dark blot in the white drifts, stood a small house. Upon this house",OH

12334,descended--or rather ascended--Judge Menefee and his cohorts with boyish,OH

12335,whoops born of the snow and stress. They called; they pounded at window and,OH

12336,door. At the inhospitable silence they waxed restive; they assaulted and forced,OH

12337,"the pregnable barriers, and invaded the premises.",OH

12338,The watchers from the coach heard stumblings and shoutings from the interior,OH

12339,"of the ravaged house. Before long a light within flickered, glowed, flamed",OH

12340,high and bright and cheerful. Then came running back through the driving,OH

12341,flakes the exuberant explorers. More deeply pitched than the clarion--even,OH

12342,orchestral in volume--the voice of Judge Menefee proclaimed the succour that,OH

12343,lay in apposition with their state of travail. The one room of the house was,OH

12344,"uninhabited, he said, and bare of furniture; but it contained a great fireplace,",OH

12345,and they had discovered an ample store of chopped wood in a lean-to at the,OH

12346,rear. Housing and warmth against the shivering night were thus assured. For,OH

12347,"the placation of Bildad Rose there was news of a stable, not ruined beyond",OH

12348,"service, with hay in a loft, near the house.",OH

12349,"""Gentlemen,"" cried Bildad Rose from his seat, swathed in coats and robes,",OH

12350,"""tear me down two panels of that fence, so I can drive in. That is old man",OH

12351,Redruth's shanty. I thought we must be nigh it. They took him to the foolish,OH

12352,"house in August.""",OH

12353,Cheerfully the four passengers sprang at the snow-capped rails. The exhorted,OH

12354,team tugged the coach up the slant to the door of the edifice from which a,OH

12355,mid-summer madness had ravished its proprietor. The driver and two of the,OH

12356,"passengers began to unhitch. Judge Menefee opened the door of the coach, and",OH

12357,removed his hat.,OH

12358,"""I have to announce, Miss Garland,"" said he, ""the enforced suspension of our",OH

12359,journey. The driver asserts that the risk in travelling the mountain road by,OH

12360,night is too great even to consider. It will be necessary to remain in the shelter,OH

12361,of this house until morning. I beg that you will feel that there is nothing to fear,OH

12362,"beyond a temporary inconvenience. I have personally inspected the house, and",OH

12363,"find that there are means to provide against the rigour of the weather, at least.",OH

12364,You shall be made as comfortable as possible. Permit me to assist you to,OH

12365,"alight.""",OH

12366,To the Judge's side came the passenger whose pursuit in life was the placing of,OH

12367,the Little Goliath windmill. His name was Dunwoody; but that matters not,OH

12368,much. In travelling merely from Paradise to Sunrise City one needs little or no,OH

12369,"name. Still, one who would seek to divide honours with Judge Madison L.",OH

12370,Menefee deserves a cognomenal peg upon which Fame may hang a wreath.,OH

12371,"Thus spake, loudly and buoyantly, the aerial miller:",OH

12372,"""Guess you'll have to climb out of the ark, Mrs. McFarland. This wigwam isn't",OH

12373,"exactly the Palmer House, but it turns snow, and they won't search your grip",OH

12374,for souvenir spoons when you leave. /We've/ got a fire going; and /we'll/ fix,OH

12375,"you up with dry Tilbys and keep the mice away, anyhow, all right, all right.""",OH

12376,"One of the two passengers who were struggling in a melee of horses, harness,",OH

12377,"snow, and the sarcastic injunctions of Bildad Rose, called loudly from the",OH

12378,"whirl of his volunteer duties: ""Say! some of you fellows get Miss Solomon",OH

12379,"into the house, will you? Whoa, there! you confounded brute!""",OH

12380,Again must it be gently urged that in travelling from Paradise to Sunrise City,OH

12381,an accurate name is prodigality. When Judge Menefee-- sanctioned to the act,OH

12382,by his grey hair and widespread repute--had introduced himself to the lady,OH

12383,"passenger, she had, herself, sweetly breathed a name, in response, that the",OH

12384,hearing of the male passengers had variously interpreted. In the not unjealous,OH

12385,"spirit of rivalry that eventuated, each clung stubbornly to his own theory. For",OH

12386,the lady passenger to have reasseverated or corrected would have seemed,OH

12387,didactic if not unduly solicitous of a specific acquaintance. Therefore the lady,OH

12388,passenger permitted herself to be Garlanded and McFarlanded and Solomoned,OH

12389,with equal and discreet complacency. It is thirty-five miles from Paradise to,OH

12390,"Sunrise City. /Compagnon de voyage/ is name enough, by the gripsack of the",OH

12391,Wandering Jew! for so brief a journey.,OH

12392,Soon the little party of wayfarers were happily seated in a cheerful arc before,OH

12393,"the roaring fire. The robes, cushions, and removable portions of the coach had",OH

12394,been brought in and put to service. The lady passenger chose a place near the,OH

12395,hearth at one end of the arc. There she graced almost a throne that her subjects,OH

12396,had prepared. She sat upon cushions and leaned against an empty box and,OH

12397,"barrel, robe bespread, which formed a defence from the invading draughts.",OH

12398,"She extended her feet, delectably shod, to the cordial heat. She ungloved her",OH

12399,"hands, but retained about her neck her long fur boa. The unstable flames half",OH

12400,"revealed, while the warding boa half submerged, her face-- a youthful face,",OH

12401,"altogether feminine, clearly moulded and calm with beauty's unchallenged",OH

12402,confidence. Chivalry and manhood were here vying to please and comfort her.,OH

12403,"She seemed to accept their devoirs--not piquantly, as one courted and",OH

12404,"attended; nor preeningly, as many of her sex unworthily reap their honours;",OH

12405,"not yet stolidly, as the ox receives his hay; but concordantly with nature's own",OH

12406,plan--as the lily ingests the drop of dew foreordained to its refreshment.,OH

12407,"Outside the wind roared mightily, the fine snow whizzed through the cracks,",OH

12408,the cold besieged the backs of the immolated six; but the elements did not lack,OH

12409,a champion that night. Judge Menefee was attorney for the storm. The weather,OH

12410,"was his client, and he strove by special pleading to convince his companions",OH

12411,"in that frigid jury-box that they sojourned in a bower of roses, beset only by",OH

12412,"benignant zephyrs. He drew upon a fund of gaiety, wit, and anecdote,",OH

12413,"sophistical, but crowned with success. His cheerfulness communicated itself",OH

12414,irresistibly. Each one hastened to contribute his own quota toward the general,OH

12415,optimism. Even the lady passenger was moved to expression.,OH

12416,"""I think it is quite charming,"" she said, in her slow, crystal tones.",OH

12417,At intervals some one of the passengers would rise and humorously explore,OH

12418,the room. There was little evidence to be collected of its habitation by old man,OH

12419,Redruth.,OH

12420,"Bildad Rose was called upon vivaciously for the ex-hermit's history. Now,",OH

12421,since the stage-driver's horses were fairly comfortable and his passengers,OH

12422,"appeared to be so, peace and comity returned to him.",OH

12423,"""The old didapper,"" began Bildad, somewhat irreverently, ""infested this here",OH

12424,house about twenty year. He never allowed nobody to come nigh him. He'd,OH

12425,duck his head inside and slam the door whenever a team drove along. There,OH

12426,"was spinning-wheels up in his loft, all right. He used to buy his groceries and",OH

12427,"tobacco at Sam Tilly's store, on the Little Muddy. Last August he went up",OH

12428,"there dressed in a red bedquilt, and told Sam he was King Solomon, and that",OH

12429,the Queen of Sheba was coming to visit him. He fetched along all the money,OH

12430,he had--a little bag full of silver--and dropped it in Sam's well. 'She won't,OH

12431,"come,' says old man Redruth to Sam, 'if she knows I've got any money.'",OH

12432,"""As soon as folks heard he had that sort of a theory about women and money",OH

12438,say he had had unfortunateness in the way of love derangements with a young,OH

12439,lady when he was young; before he contracted red bed-quilts and had his,OH

12440,"financial conclusions disqualified. I never heard of no romance.""",OH

12441,"""Ah!"" exclaimed Judge Menefee, impressively; ""a case of unrequited",OH

12442,"affection, no doubt.""",OH

12443,"""No, sir,"" returned Bildad, ""not at all. She never married him. Marmaduke",OH

12444,"Mulligan, down at Paradise, seen a man once that come from old Redruth's",OH

12445,"town. He said Redruth was a fine young man, but when you kicked him on the",OH

12446,pocket all you could hear jingle was a cuff-fastener and a bunch of keys. He,OH

12447,was engaged to this young lady--Miss Alice-- something was her name; I've,OH

12448,forgot. This man said she was the kind of girl you like to have reach across,OH

12449,"you in a car to pay the fare. Well, there come to the town a young chap all",OH

12450,"affluent and easy, and fixed up with buggies and mining stock and leisure",OH

12451,"time. Although she was a staked claim, Miss Alice and the new entry seemed",OH

12452,to strike a mutual kind of a clip. They had calls and coincidences of going to,OH

12453,the post office and such things as sometimes make a girl send back the,OH

12454,"engagement ring and other presents--'a rift within the loot,' the poetry man",OH

12455,calls it.,OH

12456,"""One day folks seen Redruth and Miss Alice standing talking at the gate. Then",OH

12457,"he lifts his hat and walks away, and that was the last anybody in that town seen",OH

12458,"of him, as far as this man knew.""",OH

12459,"""What about the young lady?"" asked the young man who had an Agency.",OH

12460,"""Never heard,"" answered Bildad. ""Right there is where my lode of information",OH

12461,"turns to an old spavined crowbait, and folds its wings, for I've pumped it dry.""",OH

12462,"""A very sad--"" began Judge Menefee, but his remark was curtailed by a higher",OH

12463,authority.,OH

12464,"""What a charming story!"" said the lady passenger, in flute-like tones.",OH

12465,"A little silence followed, except for the wind and the crackling of the fire.",OH

12466,"The men were seated upon the floor, having slightly mitigated its inhospitable",OH

12467,surface with wraps and stray pieces of boards. The man who was placing Little,OH

12468,Goliath windmills arose and walked about to ease his cramped muscles.,OH

12469,Suddenly a triumphant shout came from him. He hurried back from a dusky,OH

12470,"corner of the room, bearing aloft something in his hand. It was an apple--a",OH

12471,"large, red-mottled, firm pippin, pleasing to behold. In a paper bag on a high",OH

12472,shelf in that corner he had found it. It could have been no relic of the,OH

12473,"lovewrecked Redruth, for its glorious soundness repudiated the theory that it",OH

12474,"had lain on that musty shelf since August. No doubt some recent bivouackers,",OH

12475,"lunching in the deserted house, had left it there.",OH

12476,"Dunwoody--again his exploits demand for him the honours of nomenclature-flaunted his apple in the faces of his fellow-marooners. ""See what I found,",OH

12477,"Mrs. McFarland!"" he cried, vaingloriously. He held the apple high up in the",OH

12478,"light of the fire, where it glowed a still richer red. The lady passenger smiled",OH

12479,calmly--always calmly.,OH

12480,"""What a charming apple!"" she murmured, clearly.",OH

12481,"For a brief space Judge Menefee felt crushed, humiliated, relegated. Second",OH

12482,"place galled him. Why had this blatant, obtrusive, unpolished man of",OH

12483,windmills been selected by Fate instead of himself to discover the sensational,OH

12484,"apple? He could have made of the act a scene, a function, a setting for some",OH

12485,"impromptu, fanciful discourse or piece of comedy--and have retained the role",OH

12486,"of cynosure. Actually, the lady passenger was regarding this ridiculous",OH

12487,"Dunboddy or Woodbundy with an admiring smile, as if the fellow had",OH

12488,performed a feat! And the windmill man swelled and gyrated like a sample of,OH

12489,"his own goods, puffed up with the wind that ever blows from the chorus land",OH

12490,toward the domain of the star.,OH

12491,"While the transported Dunwoody, with his Aladdin's apple, was receiving the",OH

12492,"fickle attentions of all, the resourceful jurist formed a plan to recover his own",OH

12493,laurels.,OH

12494,"With his courtliest smile upon his heavy but classic features, Judge Menefee",OH

12495,"advanced, and took the apple, as if to examine it, from the hand of Dunwoody.",OH

12496,In his hand it became Exhibit A.,OH

12497,"""A fine apple,"" he said, approvingly. ""Really, my dear Mr. Dudwindy, you",OH

12498,have eclipsed all of us as a forager. But I have an idea. This apple shall,OH

12499,"become an emblem, a token, a symbol, a prize bestowed by the mind and heart",OH

12500,"of beauty upon the most deserving.""",OH

12501,"The audience, except one, applauded. ""Good on the stump, ain't he?""",OH

12502,commented the passenger who was nobody in particular to the young man,OH

12503,who had an Agency.,OH

12504,The unresponsive one was the windmill man. He saw himself reduced to the,OH

12505,ranks. Never would the thought have occurred to him to declare his apple an,OH

12506,"emblem. He had intended, after it had been divided and eaten, to create",OH

12507,diversion by sticking the seeds against his forehead and naming them for,OH

12508,young ladies of his acquaintance. One he was going to name Mrs. McFarland.,OH

12509,The seed that fell off first would be--but 'twas too late now.,OH

12510,"""The apple,"" continued Judge Menefee, charging his jury, ""in modern days",OH

12511,"occupies, though undeservedly, a lowly place in our esteem. Indeed, it is so",OH

12512,constantly associated with the culinary and the commercial that it is hardly to,OH

12513,be classed among the polite fruits. But in ancient times this was not so.,OH

12514,"Biblical, historical, and mythological lore abounds with evidences that the",OH

12515,apple was the aristocrat of fruits. We still say 'the apple of the eye' when we,OH

12516,wish to describe something superlatively precious. We find in Proverbs the,OH

12517,comparison to 'apples of silver.' No other product of tree or vine has been so,OH

12518,utilised in figurative speech. Who has not heard of and longed for the 'apples,OH

12519,of the Hesperides'? I need not call your attention to the most tremendous and,OH

12520,significant instance of the apple's ancient prestige when its consumption by,OH

12521,our first parents occasioned the fall of man from his state of goodness and,OH

12522,"perfection.""",OH

12523,"""Apples like them,"" said the windmill man, lingering with the objective article,",OH

12524,"""are worth $3.50 a barrel in the Chicago market.""",OH

12525,"""Now, what I have to propose,"" said Judge Menefee, conceding an indulgent",OH

12526,"smile to his interrupter, ""is this: We must remain here, perforce, until morning.",OH

12527,We have wood in plenty to keep us warm. Our next need is to entertain,OH

12528,"ourselves as best we can, in order that the time shall not pass too slowly. I",OH

12529,propose that we place this apple in the hands of Miss Garland. It is no longer a,OH

12530,"fruit, but, as I said, a prize, in award, representing a great human idea. Miss",OH

12531,"Garland, herself, shall cease to be an individual--but only temporarily, I am",OH

12532,"happy to add""--(a low bow, full of the old-time grace). ""She shall represent her",OH

12533,"sex; she shall be the embodiment, the epitome of womankind--the heart and",OH

12534,"brain, I may say, of God's masterpiece of creation. In this guise she shall judge",OH

12535,and decide the question which follows:,OH

12536,"""But a few minutes ago our friend, Mr. Rose, favoured us with an entertaining",OH

12537,but fragmentary sketch of the romance in the life of the former professor of,OH

12538,this habitation. The few facts that we have learned seem to me to open up a,OH

12539,"fascinating field for conjecture, for the study of human hearts, for the exercise",OH

12540,"of the imagination--in short, for story-telling. Let us make use of the",OH

12541,"opportunity. Let each one of us relate his own version of the story of Redruth,",OH

12542,"the hermit, and his lady-love, beginning where Mr. Rose's narrative ends--at",OH

12543,the parting of the lovers at the gate. This much should be assumed and,OH

12544,conceded--that the young lady was not necessarily to blame for Redruth's,OH

12545,"becoming a crazed and world-hating hermit. When we have done, Miss",OH

12546,Garland shall render the JUDGEMENT OF WOMAN. As the Spirit of her Sex,OH

12547,she shall decide which version of the story best and most truly depicts human,OH

12548,"and love interest, and most faithfully estimates the character and acts of",OH

12549,Redruth's betrothed according to the feminine view. The apple shall be,OH

12550,"bestowed upon him who is awarded the decision. If you are all agreed, we",OH

12551,"shall be pleased to hear the first story from Mr. Dinwiddie.""",OH

12552,The last sentence captured the windmill man. He was not one to linger in the,OH

12553,dumps.,OH

12554,"""That's a first-rate scheme, Judge,"" he said, heartily. ""Be a regular short-story",OH

12555,"vaudeville, won't it? I used to be correspondent for a paper in Springfield, and",OH

12556,"when there wasn't any news I faked it. Guess I can do my turn all right.""",OH

12557,"""I think the idea is charming,"" said the lady passenger, brightly. ""It will be",OH

12558,"almost like a game.""",OH

12559,Judge Menefee stepped forward and placed the apple in her hand impressively.,OH

12560,"""In olden days,"" he said, orotundly, ""Paris awarded the golden apple to the",OH

12561,"most beautiful.""",OH

12562,"""I was at the Exposition,"" remarked the windmill man, now cheerful again,",OH

12563,"""but I never heard of it. And I was on the Midway, too, all the time I wasn't at",OH

12564,"the machinery exhibit.""",OH

12565,"""But now,"" continued the Judge, ""the fruit shall translate to us the mystery and",OH

12566,"wisdom of the feminine heart. Take the apple, Miss Garland. Hear our modest",OH

12567,"tales of romance, and then award the prize as you may deem it just.""",OH

12568,The lady passenger smiled sweetly. The apple lay in her lap beneath her robes,OH

12569,"and wraps. She reclined against her protecting bulwark, brightly and cosily at",OH

12570,ease. But for the voices and the wind one might have listened hopefully to,OH

12571,hear her purr. Someone cast fresh logs upon the fire. Judge Menefee nodded,OH

12572,"suavely. ""Will you oblige us with the initial story?"" he asked.",OH

12573,"The windmill man sat as sits a Turk, with his hat well back on his head on",OH

12574,account of the draughts.,OH

12575,"""Well,"" he began, without any embarrassment, ""this is about the way I size up",OH

12576,the difficulty: Of course Redruth was jostled a good deal by this duck who had,OH

12577,money to play ball with who tried to cut him out of his girl. So he goes,OH

12578,"around, naturally, and asks her if the game is still square. Well, nobody wants",OH

12579,a guy cutting in with buggies and gold bonds when he's got an option on a girl.,OH

12580,"Well, he goes around to see her. Well, maybe he's hot, and talks like the",OH

12581,"proprietor, and forgets that an engagement ain't always a lead-pipe cinch. Well,",OH

12582,"I guess that makes Alice warm under the lacy yoke. Well, she answers back",OH

12583,"sharp. Well, he--""",OH

12584,"""Say!"" interrupted the passenger who was nobody in particular, ""if you could",OH

12585,"put up a windmill on every one of them 'wells' you're using, you'd be able to",OH

12586,"retire from business, wouldn't you?""",OH

12587,The windmill man grinned good-naturedly.,OH

12588,"""Oh, I ain't no /Guy de Mopassong/,"" he said, cheerfully. ""I'm giving it to you",OH

12589,"in straight American. Well, she says something like this: 'Mr. Gold Bonds is",OH

12590,"only a friend,' says she; 'but he takes me riding and buys me theatre tickets,",OH

12591,and that's what you never do. Ain't I to never have any pleasure in life while I,OH

12592,"can?' 'Pass this chatfield- chatfield thing along,' says Redruth;--'hand out the",OH

12593,mitt to the Willie with creases in it or you don't put your slippers under my,OH

12594,wardrobe.',OH

12595,"""Now that kind of train orders don't go with a girl that's got any spirit. I bet",OH

12596,"that girl loved her honey all the time. Maybe she only wanted, as girls do, to",OH

12597,work the good thing for a little fun and caramels before she settled down to,OH

12598,"patch George's other pair, and be a good wife. But he is glued to the high",OH

12599,"horse, and won't come down. Well, she hands him back the ring, proper",OH

12600,enough; and George goes away and hits the booze. Yep. That's what done it. I,OH

12601,bet that girl fired the cornucopia with the fancy vest two days after her steady,OH

12602,left. George boards a freight and checks his bag of crackers for parts unknown.,OH

12603,He sticks to Old Booze for a number of years; and then the aniline and,OH

12604,"aquafortis gets the decision. 'Me for the hermit's hut,' says George, 'and the",OH

12605,"long whiskers, and the buried can of money that isn't there.'",OH

12606,"""But that Alice, in my mind, was on the level. She never married, but took up",OH

12607,"typewriting as soon as the wrinkles began to show, and kept a cat that came",OH

12608,when you said 'weeny--weeny--weeny!' I got too much faith in good women to,OH

12619,bade her good-by and went out into the world to seek his fortune. He knew his,OH

12620,love would remain true to him. He scorned the thought that his rival could,OH

12621,make an impression upon a heart so fond and faithful. I would say that Mr.,OH

12622,Redruth went out to the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming to seek for gold. One,OH

12623,"day a crew of pirates landed and captured him while at work, and--""",OH

12626,"how they sailed--""",OH

12627,"""Landed from a train,"" said the narrator, quietly and not without some",OH

12628,"readiness. ""They kept him prisoner in a cave for months, and then they took",OH

12629,him hundreds of miles away to the forests of Alaska. There a beautiful Indian,OH

12637,"Mr. Redruth, as he knelt sadly by Alice's grave. 'When he found out,' she",OH

12652,women the calamities of life. My testimony in regards to the fiction story you,OH

12653,"ask for, Judge, will be about as follows: What ailed Redruth was pure laziness.",OH

12654,If he had up and slugged this Percival De Lacey that tried to give him the,OH

12655,"outside of the road, and had kept Alice in the grape-vine swing with the blindbridle on, all would have been well. The woman you want is sure worth taking",OH

12656,pains for.,OH

12657,"""'Send for me if you want me again,' says Redruth, and hoists his Stetson, and",OH

12658,"walks off. He'd have called it pride, but the nixycomlogical name for it is",OH

12659,"laziness. No woman don't like to run after a man. 'Let him come back, hisself,'",OH

12660,says the girl; and I'll be bound she tells the boy with the pay ore to trot; and,OH

12661,then spends her time watching out the window for the man with the empty,OH

12663,"""I reckon Redruth waits about nine year expecting her to send him a note by a",OH

12664,"nigger asking him to forgive her. But she don't. 'This game won't work,' says",OH

12665,Redruth; 'then so won't I.' And he goes in the hermit business and raises,OH

12666,whiskers. Yes; laziness and whiskers was what done the trick. They travel,OH

12667,together. You ever hear of a man with long whiskers and hair striking a,OH

12712,"him to account for, or else be docked. Where did he spend that ten and two",OH

12713,fives? I'll give you my idea. Up for bigamy. Say there was the fat blonde in,OH

12714,"Saint Jo, and the panatela brunette at Skillet Ridge, and the gold tooth down in",OH

12791,THE MISSING CHORD,OH

12792,"I stopped overnight at the sheep-ranch of Rush Kinney, on the Sandy Fork of",OH

12795,"next morning we were, according to the Texas code, undeniable friends.",OH

12796,After supper the ranchman and I lugged our chairs outside the two-room,OH

12797,"house, to its floorless gallery roofed with chaparral and sacuista grass. With",OH

12798,"the rear legs of our chairs sinking deep into the hardpacked loam, each of us",OH

12799,"reposed against an elm pillar of the structure and smoked El Toro tobacco,",OH

12800,while we wrangled amicably concerning the affairs of the rest of the world.,OH

12801,As for conveying adequate conception of the engaging charm of that prairie,OH

12802,"evening, despair waits upon it. It is a bold chronicler who will undertake the",OH

12803,description of a Texas night in the early spring. An inventory must suffice.,OH

12804,"The ranch rested upon the summit of a lenient slope. The ambient prairie,",OH

12805,"diversified by arroyos and murky patches of brush and pear, lay around us like",OH

12806,a darkened bowl at the bottom of which we reposed as dregs. Like a turquoise,OH

12807,"cover the sky pinned us there. The miraculous air, heady with ozone and made",OH

12808,"memorably sweet by leagues of wild flowerets, gave tang and savour to the",OH

12809,"breath. In the sky was a great, round, mellow searchlight which we knew to be",OH

12810,"no moon, but the dark lantern of summer, who came to hunt northward the",OH

12811,cowering spring. In the nearest corral a flock of sheep lay silent until a,OH

12812,groundless panic would send a squad of them huddling together with a,OH

12813,drumming rush. For other sounds a shrill family of coyotes yapped beyond the,OH

12814,"shearing-pen, and whippoorwills twittered in the long grass. But even these",OH

12815,dissonances hardly rippled the clear torrent of the mocking-birds' notes that,OH

12816,fell from a dozen neighbouring shrubs and trees. It would not have been,OH

12817,"preposterous for one to tiptoe and essay to touch the stars, they hung so bright",OH

12818,and imminent.,OH

12819,"Mr. Kinney's wife, a young and capable woman, we had left in the house. She",OH

12820,"remained to busy herself with the domestic round of duties, in which I had",OH

12821,observed that she seemed to take a buoyant and contented pride. In one room,OH

12822,"we had supped. Presently, from the other, as Kinney and I sat without, there",OH

12823,burst a volume of sudden and brilliant music. If I could justly estimate the art,OH

12824,"of piano-playing, the construer of that rollicking fantasia had creditably",OH

12825,"mastered the secrets of the keyboard. A piano, and one so well played, seemed",OH

12826,"to me to be an unusual thing to find in that small and unpromising ranchhouse. I must have looked my surprise at Rush Kinney, for he laughed in his",OH

12828,cigarettes.,OH

12829,"""You don't often hear as agreeable a noise as that on a sheep-ranch,"" he",OH

12830,"remarked; ""but I never see any reason for not playing up to the arts and graces",OH

12831,just because we happen to live out in the brush. It's a lonesome life for a,OH

12845,"""That's where this music proposition started,"" said Kinney. ""I don't mind",OH

12846,telling you about it while we smoke. That's where old Cal Adams lived. He,OH

12847,had about eight hundred graded merinos and a daughter that was solid silk and,OH

12848,as handsome as a new stake-rope on a thirty-dollar pony. And I don't mind,OH

12849,telling you that I was guilty in the second degree of hanging around old Cal's,OH

12850,ranch all the time I could spare away from lambing and shearing. Miss Marilla,OH

12851,was her name; and I had figured it out by the rule of two that she was destined,OH

12852,"to become the chatelaine and lady superior of Rancho Lomito, belonging to R.",OH

12853,"Kinney, Esq., where you are now a welcome and honoured guest.",OH

12854,"""I will say that old Cal wasn't distinguished as a sheepman. He was a little, old",OH

12855,"stoop-shouldered /hombre/ about as big as a gun scabbard, with scraggy white",OH

12856,"whiskers, and condemned to the continuous use of language. Old Cal was so",OH

12857,obscure in his chosen profession that he wasn't even hated by the cowmen.,OH

12858,And when a sheepman don't get eminent enough to acquire the hostility of the,OH

12859,"cattlemen, he is mighty apt to die unwept and considerably unsung.",OH

12860,"""But that Marilla girl was a benefit to the eye. And she was the most elegant",OH

12861,"kind of a housekeeper. I was the nearest neighbour, and I used to ride over to",OH

12862,the Double-Elm anywhere from nine to sixteen times a week with fresh butter,OH

12863,or a quarter of venison or a sample of new sheep-dip just as a frivolous excuse,OH

12864,"to see Marilla. Marilla and me got to be extensively inveigled with each other,",OH

12865,and I was pretty sure I was going to get my rope around her neck and lead her,OH

12866,over to the Lomito. Only she was so everlastingly permeated with filial,OH

12867,sentiments toward old Cal that I never could get her to talk about serious,OH

12868,matters.,OH

12869,"""You never saw anybody in your life that was as full of knowledge and had",OH

12870,less sense than old Cal. He was advised about all the branches of information,OH

12871,"contained in learning, and he was up to all the rudiments of doctrines and",OH

12872,enlightenment. You couldn't advance him any ideas on any of the parts of,OH

12873,speech or lines of thought. You would have thought he was a professor of the,OH

12874,weather and politics and chemistry and natural history and the origin of,OH

12875,derivations. Any subject you brought up old Cal could give you an abundant,OH

13239,"bunch of strayed yearlings. He was late in setting out on his return trip, and it",OH

13240,was sundown when he struck the White Horse Crossing of the Nueces. From,OH

13241,there to his own camp it was sixteen miles. To the Espinosa ranch it was,OH

13242,twelve. Givens was tired. He decided to pass the night at the Crossing.,OH

13243,There was a fine water hole in the river-bed. The banks were thickly covered,OH

13244,"with great trees, undergrown with brush. Back from the water hole fifty yards",OH

13245,was a stretch of curly mesquite grass--supper for his horse and bed for himself.,OH

13246,"Givens staked his horse, and spread out his saddle blankets to dry. He sat",OH

13247,down with his back against a tree and rolled a cigarette. From somewhere in,OH

13248,"the dense timber along the river came a sudden, rageful, shivering wail. The",OH

13249,pony danced at the end of his rope and blew a whistling snort of,OH

13250,"comprehending fear. Givens puffed at his cigarette, but he reached leisurely",OH

13251,"for his pistol-belt, which lay on the grass, and twirled the cylinder of his",OH

13252,weapon tentatively. A great gar plunged with a loud splash into the water hole.,OH

13253,A little brown rabbit skipped around a bunch of catclaw and sat twitching his,OH

13254,whiskers and looking humorously at Givens. The pony went on eating grass.,OH

13255,It is well to be reasonably watchful when a Mexican lion sings soprano along,OH

13256,the arroyos at sundown. The burden of his song may be that young calves and,OH

13257,"fat lambs are scarce, and that he has a carnivorous desire for your",OH

13258,acquaintance.,OH

13259,"In the grass lay an empty fruit can, cast there by some former sojourner.",OH

13260,Givens caught sight of it with a grunt of satisfaction. In his coat pocket tied,OH

13261,behind his saddle was a handful or two of ground coffee. Black coffee and,OH

13262,cigarettes! What ranchero could desire more?,OH

13263,"In two minutes he had a little fire going clearly. He started, with his can, for",OH

13264,"the water hole. When within fifteen yards of its edge he saw, between the",OH

13265,"bushes, a side-saddled pony with down-dropped reins cropping grass a little",OH

13266,distance to his left. Just rising from her hands and knees on the brink of the,OH

13267,"water hole was Josefa O'Donnell. She had been drinking water, and she",OH

13268,"brushed the sand from the palms of her hands. Ten yards away, to her right,",OH

13269,"half concealed by a clump of sacuista, Givens saw the crouching form of the",OH

13270,Mexican lion. His amber eyeballs glared hungrily; six feet from them was the,OH

13271,"tip of the tail stretched straight, like a pointer's. His hind-quarters rocked with",OH

13272,the motion of the cat tribe preliminary to leaping.,OH

13273,Givens did what he could. His six-shooter was thirty-five yards away lying on,OH

13274,"the grass. He gave a loud yell, and dashed between the lion and the princess.",OH

13275,"The ""rucus,"" as Givens called it afterward, was brief and somewhat confused.",OH

13276,"When he arrived on the line of attack he saw a dim streak in the air, and heard",OH

13277,a couple of faint cracks. Then a hundred pounds of Mexican lion plumped,OH

13278,"down upon his head and flattened him, with a heavy jar, to the ground. He",OH

13279,"remembered calling out: ""Let up, now--no fair gouging!"" and then he crawled",OH

13280,"from under the lion like a worm, with his mouth full of grass and dirt, and a",OH

13281,big lump on the back of his head where it had struck the root of a water-elm.,OH

13282,"The lion lay motionless. Givens, feeling aggrieved, and suspicious of fouls,",OH

13283,"shook his fist at the lion, and shouted: ""I'll rastle you again for twenty--"" and",OH

13284,then he got back to himself.,OH

13285,"Josefa was standing in her tracks, quietly reloading her silver- mounted .38. It",OH

13286,had not been a difficult shot. The lion's head made an easier mark than a,OH

13287,"tomato-can swinging at the end of a string. There was a provoking, teasing,",OH

13288,maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes. The would-be-rescuing,OH

13289,knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul. Here had been his,OH

13290,"chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had",OH

13291,"presided over it. The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in",OH

13292,"hilarious, silent laughter. There had been something like vaudeville--say",OH

13293,Signor Givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion.,OH

13294,"""Is that you, Mr. Givens?"" said Josefa, in her deliberate, saccharine contralto.",OH

13295,"""You nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled. Did you hurt your head when you",OH

13296,"fell?""",OH

13297,"""Oh, no,"" said Givens, quietly; ""that didn't hurt."" He stooped ignominiously",OH

13298,and dragged his best Stetson hat from under the beast. It was crushed and,OH

13299,wrinkled to a fine comedy effect. Then he knelt down and softly stroked the,OH

13300,"fierce, open-jawed head of the dead lion.",OH

13301,"""Poor old Bill!"" he exclaimed mournfully.",OH

13302,"""What's that?"" asked Josefa, sharply.",OH

13303,"""Of course you didn't know, Miss Josefa,"" said Givens, with an air of one",OH

13304,"allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief. ""Nobody can blame you. I tried",OH

13305,"to save him, but I couldn't let you know in time.""",OH

13306,"""Save who?""",OH

13307,"""Why, Bill. I've been looking for him all day. You see, he's been our camp pet",OH

13308,"for two years. Poor old fellow, he wouldn't have hurt a cottontail rabbit. It'll",OH

13309,"break the boys all up when they hear about it. But you couldn't tell, of course,",OH

13310,"that Bill was just trying to play with you.""",OH

13311,Josefa's black eyes burned steadily upon him. Ripley Givens met the test,OH

13312,successfully. He stood rumpling the yellow-brown curls on his head pensively.,OH

13313,"In his eye was regret, not unmingled with a gentle reproach. His smooth",OH

13314,features were set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow. Josefa wavered.,OH

13315,"""What was your pet doing here?"" she asked, making a last stand. ""There's no",OH

13316,"camp near the White Horse Crossing.""",OH

13317,"""The old rascal ran away from camp yesterday,"" answered Givens readily. ""It's",OH

13318,"a wonder the coyotes didn't scare him to death. You see, Jim Webster, our",OH

13319,"horse wrangler, brought a little terrier pup into camp last week. The pup made",OH

13320,life miserable for Bill--he used to chase him around and chew his hind legs for,OH

13321,hours at a time. Every night when bedtime came Bill would sneak under one,OH

13322,of the boy's blankets and sleep to keep the pup from finding him. I reckon he,OH

13323,must have been worried pretty desperate or he wouldn't have run away. He,OH

13324,"was always afraid to get out of sight of camp.""",OH

13325,Josefa looked at the body of the fierce animal. Givens gently patted one of the,OH

13326,formidable paws that could have killed a yearling calf with one blow. Slowly a,OH

13327,red flush widened upon the dark olive face of the girl. Was it the signal of,OH

13328,shame of the true sportsman who has brought down ignoble quarry? Her eyes,OH

13329,"grew softer, and the lowered lids drove away all their bright mockery.",OH

13330,"""I'm very sorry,"" she said humbly; ""but he looked so big, and jumped so high",OH

13331,"that--""",OH

13332,"""Poor old Bill was hungry,"" interrupted Givens, in quick defence of the",OH

13333,"deceased. ""We always made him jump for his supper in camp. He would lie",OH

13334,down and roll over for a piece of meat. When he saw you he thought he was,OH

13335,"going to get something to eat from you.""",OH

13336,Suddenly Josefa's eyes opened wide.,OH

13337,"""I might have shot you!"" she exclaimed. ""You ran right in between. You risked",OH

13338,"your life to save your pet! That was fine, Mr. Givens. I like a man who is kind",OH

13339,"to animals.""",OH

13340,"Yes; there was even admiration in her gaze now. After all, there was a hero",OH

13341,rising out of the ruins of the anti-climax. The look on Givens's face would,OH

13342,have secured him a high position in the S.P.C.A.,OH

13343,"""I always loved 'em,"" said he; ""horses, dogs, Mexican lions, cows, alligators--""",OH

13344,"""I hate alligators,"" instantly demurred Josefa; ""crawly, muddy things!""",OH

13345,"""Did I say alligators?"" said Givens. ""I meant antelopes, of course.""",OH

13346,Josefa's conscience drove her to make further amends. She held out her hand,OH

13347,"penitently. There was a bright, unshed drop in each of her eyes.",OH

13348,"""Please forgive me, Mr. Givens, won't you? I'm only a girl, you know, and I",OH

13349,"was frightened at first. I'm very, very sorry I shot Bill. You don't know how",OH

13350,"ashamed I feel. I wouldn't have done it for anything.""",OH

13351,Givens took the proffered hand. He held it for a time while he allowed the,OH

13352,generosity of his nature to overcome his grief at the loss of Bill. At last it was,OH

13353,clear that he had forgiven her.,OH

13354,"""Please don't speak of it any more, Miss Josefa. 'Twas enough to frighten any",OH

13355,"young lady the way Bill looked. I'll explain it all right to the boys.""",OH

13356,"""Are you really sure you don't hate me?"" Josefa came closer to him",OH

13357,"impulsively. Her eyes were sweet--oh, sweet and pleading with gracious",OH

13358,"penitence. ""I would hate anyone who would kill my kitten. And how daring",OH

13359,and kind of you to risk being shot when you tried to save him! How very few,OH

13360,"men would have done that!"" Victory wrested from defeat! Vaudeville turned",OH

13361,"into drama! Bravo, Ripley Givens!",OH

13362,It was now twilight. Of course Miss Josefa could not be allowed to ride on to,OH

13363,the ranch-house alone. Givens resaddled his pony in spite of that animal's,OH

13364,"reproachful glances, and rode with her. Side by side they galloped across the",OH

13365,"smooth grass, the princess and the man who was kind to animals. The prairie",OH

13366,odours of fruitful earth and delicate bloom were thick and sweet around them.,OH

13367,Coyotes yelping over there on the hill! No fear. And yet-Josefa rode closer. A little hand seemed to grope. Givens found it with his,OH

13368,"own. The ponies kept an even gait. The hands lingered together, and the owner",OH

13369,of one explained:,OH

13370,"""I never was frightened before, but just think! How terrible it would be to meet",OH

13371,"a really wild lion! Poor Bill! I'm so glad you came with me!""",OH

13372,O'Donnell was sitting on the ranch gallery.,OH

13373,"""Hello, Rip!"" he shouted--""that you?""",OH

13374,"""He rode in with me,"" said Josefa. ""I lost my way and was late.""",OH

13375,"""Much obliged,"" called the cattle king. ""Stop over, Rip, and ride to camp in the",OH

13376,"morning.""",OH

13377,But Givens would not. He would push on to camp. There was a bunch of,OH

13378,"steers to start off on the trail at daybreak. He said good-night, and trotted",OH

13379,away.,OH

13380,"An hour later, when the lights were out, Josefa, in her night-robe, came to her",OH

13381,door and called to the king in his own room across the brick-paved hallway:,OH

13382,"""Say, pop, you know that old Mexican lion they call the 'Gotch-eared Devil'-the one that killed Gonzales, Mr. Martin's sheep herder, and about fifty calves",OH

13383,"on the Salado range? Well, I settled his hash this afternoon over at the White",OH

13384,Horse Crossing. Put two balls in his head with my .38 while he was on the,OH

13385,jump. I knew him by the slice gone from his left ear that old Gonzales cut off,OH

13386,"with his machete. You couldn't have made a better shot yourself, daddy.""",OH

13390,THE INDIAN SUMMER OF DRY VALLEY JOHNSON,OH

13391,Dry Valley Johnson shook the bottle. You have to shake the bottle before,OH

13392,using; for sulphur will not dissolve. Then Dry Valley saturated a small sponge,OH

13393,with the liquid and rubbed it carefully into the roots of his hair. Besides,OH

13394,sulphur there was sugar of lead in it and tincture of nux vomica and bay rum.,OH

13395,Dry Valley found the recipe in a Sunday newspaper. You must next be told,OH

13396,why a strong man came to fall a victim to a Beauty Hint.,OH

13397,"Dry Valley had been a sheepman. His real name was Hector, but he had been",OH

13398,"rechristened after his range to distinguish him from ""Elm Creek"" Johnson,",OH

13399,who ran sheep further down the Frio.,OH

13400,Many years of living face to face with sheep on their own terms wearied Dry,OH

13401,"Valley Johnson. So, he sold his ranch for eighteen thousand dollars and moved",OH

13402,to Santa Rosa to live a life of gentlemanly ease. Being a silent and melancholy,OH

13403,person of thirty-five--or perhaps thirty-eight--he soon became that cursed and,OH

13404,earth-cumbering thing--an elderlyish bachelor with a hobby. Some one gave,OH

13405,"him his first strawberry to eat, and he was done for.",OH

13406,"Dry Valley bought a four-room cottage in the village, and a library on",OH

13407,strawberry culture. Behind the cottage was a garden of which he made a,OH

13408,"strawberry patch. In his old grey woolen shirt, his brown duck trousers, and",OH

13409,high-heeled boots he sprawled all day on a canvas cot under a live-oak tree at,OH

13410,"his back door studying the history of the seductive, scarlet berry.",OH

13411,"The school teacher, Miss De Witt, spoke of him as ""a fine, presentable man,",OH

13412,"for all his middle age."" But, the focus of Dry Valley's eyes embraced no",OH

13413,women. They were merely beings who flew skirts as a signal for him to lift,OH

13414,"awkwardly his heavy, round-crowned, broad-brimmed felt Stetson whenever",OH

13415,"he met them, and then hurry past to get back to his beloved berries.",OH

13416,And all this recitative by the chorus is only to bring us to the point where you,OH

13417,may be told why Dry Valley shook up the insoluble sulphur in the bottle. So,OH

13418,long-drawn and inconsequential a thing is history--the anamorphous shadow,OH

13419,of a milestone reaching down the road between us and the setting sun.,OH

13420,When his strawberries were beginning to ripen Dry Valley bought the heaviest,OH

13421,buggy whip in the Santa Rosa store. He sat for many hours under the live oak,OH

13422,tree plaiting and weaving in an extension to its lash. When it was done he,OH

13423,"could snip a leaf from a bush twenty feet away with the cracker. For the bright,",OH

13424,"predatory eyes of Santa Rosa youth were watching the ripening berries, and",OH

13425,Dry Valley was arming himself against their expected raids. No greater care,OH

13426,had he taken of his tender lambs during his ranching days than he did of his,OH

13427,"cherished fruit, warding it from the hungry wolves that whistled and howled",OH

13428,and shot their marbles and peered through the fence that surrounded his,OH

13429,property.,OH

13430,In the house next to Dry Valley's lived a widow with a pack of children that,OH

13431,gave the husbandman frequent anxious misgivings. In the woman there was a,OH

13432,strain of the Spanish. She had wedded one of the name of O'Brien. Dry Valley,OH

13433,was a connoisseur in cross strains; and he foresaw trouble in the offspring of,OH

13434,this union.,OH

13435,Between the two homesteads ran a crazy picket fence overgrown with morning,OH

13436,glory and wild gourd vines. Often he could see little heads with mops of black,OH

13437,"hair and flashing dark eyes dodging in and out between the pickets, keeping",OH

13438,tabs on the reddening berries.,OH

13439,"Late one afternoon Dry Valley went to the post office. When he came back,",OH

13440,like Mother Hubbard he found the deuce to pay. The descendants of Iberian,OH

13441,bandits and Hibernian cattle raiders had swooped down upon his strawberry,OH

13442,patch. To the outraged vision of Dry Valley there seemed to be a sheep corral,OH

13443,full of them; perhaps they numbered five or six. Between the rows of green,OH

13444,"plants they were stooped, hopping about like toads, gobbling silently and",OH

13445,voraciously his finest fruit.,OH

13446,"Dry Valley slipped into the house, got his whip, and charged the marauders.",OH

13447,The lash curled about the legs of the nearest--a greedy ten-year-old--before,OH

13448,they knew they were discovered. His screech gave warning; and the flock,OH

13449,scampered for the fence like a drove of /javelis/ flushed in the chaparral. Dry,OH

13450,Valley's whip drew a toll of two more elfin shrieks before they dived through,OH

13451,the vine-clad fence and disappeared.,OH

13452,"Dry Valley, less fleet, followed them nearly to the pickets. Checking his",OH

13453,"useless pursuit, he rounded a bush, dropped his whip and stood, voiceless,",OH

13454,"motionless, the capacity of his powers consumed by the act of breathing and",OH

13455,preserving the perpendicular.,OH

13456,"Behind the bush stood Panchita O'Brien, scorning to fly. She was nineteen, the",OH

13457,oldest of the raiders. Her night-black hair was gathered back in a wild mass,OH

13458,"and tied with a scarlet ribbon. She stood, with reluctant feet, yet nearer the",OH

13459,brook than to the river; for childhood had environed and detained her.,OH

13460,"She looked at Dry Valley Johnson for a moment with magnificent insolence,",OH

13461,and before his eyes slowly crunched a luscious berry between her white teeth.,OH

13462,"Then she turned and walked slowly to the fence with a swaying, conscious",OH

13463,"motion, such as a duchess might make use of in leading a promenade. There",OH

13464,she turned again and grilled Dry Valley Johnson once more in the dark flame,OH

13465,"of her audacious eyes, laughed a trifle school-girlishly, and twisted herself",OH

13466,with pantherish quickness between the pickets to the O'Brien side of the wild,OH

13467,gourd vine.,OH

13468,Dry Valley picked up his whip and went into his house. He stumbled as he,OH

13469,went up the two wooden steps. The old Mexican woman who cooked his,OH

13470,meals and swept his house called him to supper as he went through the rooms.,OH

13471,"Dry Valley went on, stumbled down the front steps, out the gate and down the",OH

13472,road into a mesquite thicket at the edge of town. He sat down in the grass and,OH

13473,"laboriously plucked the spines from a prickly pear, one by one. This was his",OH

13474,"attitude of thought, acquired in the days when his problems were only those of",OH

13475,wind and wool and water.,OH

13476,"A thing had happened to the man--a thing that, if you are eligible, you must",OH

13477,pray may pass you by. He had become enveloped in the Indian Summer of the,OH

13478,Soul.,OH

13479,Dry Valley had had no youth. Even his childhood had been one of dignity and,OH

13480,seriousness. At six he had viewed the frivolous gambols of the lambs on his,OH

13481,father's ranch with silent disapproval. His life as a young man had been,OH

13482,"wasted. The divine fires and impulses, the glorious exaltations and despairs,",OH

13483,the glow and enchantment of youth had passed above his head. Never a thrill,OH

13484,of Romeo had he known; he was but a melancholy Jaques of the forest with a,OH

13485,"ruder philosophy, lacking the bitter-sweet flavour of experience that tempered",OH

13486,the veteran years of the rugged ranger of Arden. And now in his sere and,OH

13487,yellow leaf one scornful look from the eyes of Panchita O'Brien had flooded,OH

13488,the autumnal landscape with a tardy and delusive summer heat.,OH

13489,But a sheepman is a hardy animal. Dry Valley Johnson had weathered too,OH

13490,"many northers to turn his back on a late summer, spiritual or real. Old? He",OH

13491,would show them.,OH

13492,By the next mail went an order to San Antonio for an outfit of the latest,OH

13493,"clothes, colours and styles and prices no object. The next day went the recipe",OH

13494,for the hair restorer clipped from a newspaper; for Dry Valley's sunburned,OH

13495,auburn hair was beginning to turn silvery above his ears.,OH

13496,Dry Valley kept indoors closely for a week except for frequent sallies after,OH

13497,"youthful strawberry snatchers. Then, a few days later, he suddenly emerged",OH

13498,brilliantly radiant in the hectic glow of his belated midsummer madness.,OH

13499,"A jay-bird-blue tennis suit covered him outwardly, almost as far as his wrists",OH

13500,and ankles. His shirt was ox-blood; his collar winged and tall; his necktie a,OH

13501,"floating oriflamme; his shoes a venomous bright tan, pointed and shaped on",OH

13502,penitential lasts. A little flat straw hat with a striped band desecrated his,OH

13503,weather-beaten head. Lemon-coloured kid gloves protected his oak-tough,OH

13504,hands from the benignant May sunshine. This sad and optic-smiting creature,OH

13505,"teetered out of its den, smiling foolishly and smoothing its gloves for men and",OH

13506,"angels to see. To such a pass had Dry Valley Johnson been brought by Cupid,",OH

13507,who always shoots game that is out of season with an arrow from the quiver of,OH

13508,"Momus. Reconstructing mythology, he had risen, a prismatic macaw, from the",OH

13509,ashes of the grey-brown phoenix that had folded its tired wings to roost under,OH

13510,the trees of Santa Rosa.,OH

13511,Dry Valley paused in the street to allow Santa Rosans within sight of him to be,OH

13512,"stunned; and then deliberately and slowly, as his shoes required, entered Mrs.",OH

13513,O'Brien's gate.,OH

13514,Not until the eleven months' drought did Santa Rosa cease talking about Dry,OH

13515,Valley Johnson's courtship of Panchita O'Brien. It was an unclassifiable,OH

13516,"procedure; something like a combination of cake- walking, deaf-and-dumb",OH

13517,"oratory, postage stamp flirtation and parlour charades. It lasted two weeks and",OH

13518,then came to a sudden end.,OH

13519,Of course Mrs. O'Brien favoured the match as soon as Dry Valley's intentions,OH

13520,"were disclosed. Being the mother of a woman child, and therefore a charter",OH

13521,"member of the Ancient Order of the Rat-trap, she joyfully decked out Panchita",OH

13522,for the sacrifice. The girl was temporarily dazzled by having her dresses,OH

13523,"lengthened and her hair piled up on her head, and came near forgetting that she",OH

13524,"was only a slice of cheese. It was nice, too, to have as good a match as Mr.",OH

13525,Johnson paying you attentions and to see the other girls fluttering the curtains,OH

13526,at their windows to see you go by with him.,OH

13527,Dry Valley bought a buggy with yellow wheels and a fine trotter in San,OH

13528,Antonio. Every day he drove out with Panchita. He was never seen to speak to,OH

13529,her when they were walking or driving. The consciousness of his clothes kept,OH

13530,his mind busy; the knowledge that he could say nothing of interest kept him,OH

13531,dumb; the feeling that Panchita was there kept him happy.,OH

13532,"He took her to parties and dances, and to church. He tried--oh, no man ever",OH

13533,tried so hard to be young as Dry Valley did. He could not dance; but he,OH

13534,"invented a smile which he wore on these joyous occasions, a smile that, in",OH

13535,"him, was as great a concession to mirth and gaiety as turning hand-springs",OH

13536,would be in another. He began to seek the company of the young men in the,OH

13537,"town--even of the boys. They accepted him as a decided damper, for his",OH

13538,attempts at sportiveness were so forced that they might as well have essayed,OH

13539,their games in a cathedral. Neither he nor any other could estimate what,OH

13540,progress he had made with Panchita.,OH

13541,"The end came suddenly in one day, as often disappears the false afterglow",OH

13542,before a November sky and wind.,OH

13543,Dry Valley was to call for the girl one afternoon at six for a walk. An,OH

13544,afternoon walk in Santa Rosa was a feature of social life that called for the,OH

13545,pink of one's wardrobe. So Dry Valley began gorgeously to array himself; and,OH

13546,"so early that he finished early, and went over to the O'Brien cottage. As he",OH

13547,neared the porch on the crooked walk from the gate he heard sounds of revelry,OH

13548,within. He stopped and looked through the honeysuckle vines in the open,OH

13549,door.,OH

13550,Panchita was amusing her younger brothers and sisters. She wore a man's,OH

13551,clothes--no doubt those of the late Mr. O'Brien. On her head was the smallest,OH

13552,brother's straw hat decorated with an ink-striped paper band. On her hands,OH

13553,"were flapping yellow cloth gloves, roughly cut out and sewn for the",OH

13554,"masquerade. The same material covered her shoes, giving them the semblance",OH

13555,of tan leather. High collar and flowing necktie were not omitted.,OH

13556,"Panchita was an actress. Dry Valley saw his affectedly youthful gait, his limp",OH

13557,"where the right shoe hurt him, his forced smile, his awkward simulation of a",OH

13558,"gallant air, all reproduced with startling fidelity. For the first time a mirror had",OH

13559,"been held up to him. The corroboration of one of the youngsters calling,",OH

13560,"""Mamma, come and see Pancha do like Mr. Johnson,"" was not needed.",OH

13561,"As softly as the caricatured tans would permit, Dry Valley tiptoed back to the",OH

13562,gate and home again.,OH

13563,Twenty minutes after the time appointed for the walk Panchita tripped,OH

13564,"demurely out of her gate in a thin, trim white lawn and sailor hat. She strolled",OH

13565,"up the sidewalk and slowed her steps at Dry Valley's gate, her manner",OH

13566,expressing wonder at his unusual delinquency.,OH

13567,Then out of his door and down the walk strode--not the polychromatic victim,OH

13568,"of a lost summertime, but the sheepman, rehabilitated. He wore his old grey",OH

13569,"woolen shirt, open at the throat, his brown duck trousers stuffed into his runover boots, and his white felt sombrero on the back of his head. Twenty years",OH

13570,or fifty he might look; Dry Valley cared not. His light blue eyes met Panchita's,OH

13571,dark ones with a cold flash in them. He came as far as the gate. He pointed,OH

13572,with his long arm to her house.,OH

13573,"""Go home,"" said Dry Valley. ""Go home to your mother. I wonder lightnin'",OH

13574,don't strike a fool like me. Go home and play in the sand. What business have,OH

13575,you got cavortin' around with grown men? I reckon I was locoed to be makin',OH

13576,a he poll-parrot out of myself for a kid like you. Go home and don't let me see,OH

13577,"you no more. Why I done it, will somebody tell me? Go home, and let me try",OH

13578,"and forget it.""",OH

13579,"Panchita obeyed and walked slowly toward her home, saying nothing. For",OH

13580,some distance she kept her head turned and her large eyes fixed intrepidly,OH

13581,"upon Dry Valley's. At her gate she stood for a moment looking back at him,",OH

13582,then ran suddenly and swiftly into the house.,OH

13583,Old Antonia was building a fire in the kitchen stove. Dry Valley stopped at the,OH

13584,door and laughed harshly.,OH

13585,"""I'm a pretty looking old rhinoceros to be gettin' stuck on a kid, ain't I, 'Tonia?""",OH

13586,said he.,OH

13587,"""Not verree good thing,"" agreed Antonia, sagely, ""for too much old man to",OH

13588,"likee /muchacha/.""",OH

13589,"""You bet it ain't,"" said Dry Valley, grimly. ""It's dum foolishness; and, besides,",OH

13590,"it hurts.""",OH

13591,"He brought at one armful the regalia of his aberration--the blue tennis suit,",OH

13592,"shoes, hat, gloves and all, and threw them in a pile at Antonia's feet.",OH

13593,"""Give them to your old man,"" said he, ""to hunt antelope in.""",OH

13594,Just as the first star presided palely over the twilight Dry Valley got his biggest,OH

13595,strawberry book and sat on the back steps to catch the last of the reading light.,OH

13596,He thought he saw the figure of someone in his strawberry patch. He laid aside,OH

13597,"the book, got his whip and hurried forth to see.",OH

13598,It was Panchita. She had slipped through the picket fence and was half-way,OH

13599,across the patch. She stopped when she saw him and looked at him without,OH

13600,wavering.,OH

13601,A sudden rage--a humiliating flush of unreasoning wrath--came over Dry,OH

13602,Valley. For this child he had made himself a motley to the view. He had tried,OH

13603,to bribe Time to turn backward for himself; he had--been made a fool of. At,OH

13604,last he had seen his folly. There was a gulf between him and youth over which,OH

13605,he could not build a bridge even with yellow gloves to protect his hands. And,OH

13606,the sight of his torment coming to pester him with her elfin pranks--coming to,OH

13607,plunder his strawberry vines like a mischievous schoolboy--roused all his,OH

13608,anger.,OH

13609,"""I told you to keep away from here,"" said Dry Valley. ""Go back to your home.""",OH

13610,Panchita moved slowly toward him.,OH

13611,Dry Valley cracked his whip.,OH

13612,"""Go back home,"" said Dry Valley, savagely, ""and play theatricals some more.",OH

13613,"You'd make a fine man. You've made a fine one of me.""",OH

13614,"She came a step nearer, silent, and with that strange, defiant, steady shine in",OH

13615,her eyes that had always puzzled him. Now it stirred his wrath.,OH

13616,His whiplash whistled through the air. He saw a red streak suddenly come out,OH

13617,through her white dress above her knee where it had struck.,OH

13618,"Without flinching and with the same unchanging dark glow in her eyes,",OH

13619,Panchita came steadily toward him through the strawberry vines. Dry Valley's,OH

13620,trembling hand released his whip handle. When within a yard of him Panchita,OH

13621,stretched out her arms.,OH

13622,"""God, kid!"" stammered Dry Valley, ""do you mean--?""",OH

13623,"But the seasons are versatile; and it may have been Springtime, after all,",OH

13624,"instead of Indian Summer, that struck Dry Valley Johnson.",OH

13625,XVII,OH

13626,CHRISTMAS BY INJUNCTION,OH

13627,Cherokee was the civic father of Yellowhammer. Yellowhammer was a new,OH

13628,mining town constructed mainly of canvas and undressed pine. Cherokee was,OH

13629,a prospector. One day while his burro was eating quartz and pine burrs,OH

13630,"Cherokee turned up with his pick a nugget, weighing thirty ounces. He staked",OH

13631,"his claim and then, being a man of breadth and hospitality, sent out invitations",OH

13632,to his friends in three States to drop in and share his luck.,OH

13633,Not one of the invited guests sent regrets. They rolled in from the Gila,OH

13634,"country, from Salt River, from the Pecos, from Albuquerque and Phoenix and",OH

13635,"Santa Fe, and from the camps intervening.",OH

13636,When a thousand citizens had arrived and taken up claims they named the,OH

13637,"town Yellowhammer, appointed a vigilance committee, and presented",OH

13638,Cherokee with a watch-chain made of nuggets.,OH

13639,Three hours after the presentation ceremonies Cherokee's claim played out. He,OH

13640,had located a pocket instead of a vein. He abandoned it and staked others one,OH

13641,by one. Luck had kissed her hand to him. Never afterward did he turn up,OH

13642,enough dust in Yellowhammer to pay his bar bill. But his thousand invited,OH

13643,"guests were mostly prospering, and Cherokee smiled and congratulated them.",OH

13644,Yellowhammer was made up of men who took off their hats to a smiling loser;,OH

13645,so they invited Cherokee to say what he wanted.,OH

13646,"""Me?"" said Cherokee, ""oh, grubstakes will be about the thing. I reckon I'll",OH

13647,prospect along up in the Mariposas. If I strike it up there I will most certainly,OH

13648,let you all know about the facts. I never was any hand to hold out cards on my,OH

13649,"friends.""",OH

13650,"In May Cherokee packed his burro and turned its thoughtful, mouse- coloured",OH

13651,forehead to the north. Many citizens escorted him to the undefined limits of,OH

13652,Yellowhammer and bestowed upon him shouts of commendation and,OH

13653,farewells. Five pocket flasks without an air bubble between contents and cork,OH

13654,were forced upon him; and he was bidden to consider Yellowhammer in,OH

13655,"perpetual commission for his bed, bacon and eggs, and hot water for shaving",OH

13656,in the event that luck did not see fit to warm her hands by his campfire in the,OH

13657,Mariposas.,OH

13658,The name of the father of Yellowhammer was given him by the gold hunters,OH

13659,in accordance with their popular system of nomenclature. It was not necessary,OH

13660,for a citizen to exhibit his baptismal certificate in order to acquire a cognomen.,OH

13661,A man's name was his personal property. For convenience in calling him up to,OH

13662,"the bar and in designating him among other blue-shirted bipeds, a temporary",OH

13663,"appellation, title, or epithet was conferred upon him by the public. Personal",OH

13664,peculiarities formed the source of the majority of such informal baptisms.,OH

13665,Many were easily dubbed geographically from the regions from which they,OH

13666,"confessed to have hailed. Some announced themselves to be ""Thompsons,""",OH

13667,"and ""Adamses,"" and the like, with a brazenness and loudness that cast a cloud",OH

13668,upon their titles. A few vaingloriously and shamelessly uncovered their proper,OH

13669,"and indisputable names. This was held to be unduly arrogant, and did not win",OH

13670,"popularity. One man who said he was Chesterton L. C. Belmont, and proved it",OH

13671,"by letters, was given till sundown to leave the town. Such names as ""Shorty,""",OH

13672,"""Bow-legs,"" ""Texas,"" ""Lazy Bill,"" ""Thirsty Rogers,"" ""Limping Riley,"" ""The",OH

13673,"Judge,"" and ""California Ed"" were in favour. Cherokee derived his title from",OH

13674,the fact that he claimed to have lived for a time with that tribe in the Indian,OH

13675,Nation.,OH

13676,"On the twentieth day of December Baldy, the mail rider, brought",OH

13677,Yellowhammer a piece of news.,OH

13678,"""What do I see in Albuquerque,"" said Baldy, to the patrons of the bar, ""but",OH

13679,"Cherokee all embellished and festooned up like the Czar of Turkey, and",OH

13680,"lavishin' money in bulk. Him and me seen the elephant and the owl, and we",OH

13681,had specimens of this seidlitz powder wine; and Cherokee he audits all the,OH

13682,"bills, C.O.D. His pockets looked like a pool table's after a fifteen-ball run.",OH

13683,"""Cherokee must have struck pay ore,"" remarked California Ed. ""Well, he's",OH

13684,"white. I'm much obliged to him for his success.""",OH

13685,"""Seems like Cherokee would ramble down to Yellowhammer and see his",OH

13686,"friends,"" said another, slightly aggrieved. ""But that's the way. Prosperity is the",OH

13687,"finest cure there is for lost forgetfulness.""",OH

13688,"""You wait,"" said Baldy; ""I'm comin' to that. Cherokee strikes a three- foot vein",OH

13689,"up in the Mariposas that assays a trip to Europe to the ton, and he closes it out",OH

13690,to a syndicate outfit for a hundred thousand hasty dollars in cash. Then he,OH

13691,"buys himself a baby sealskin overcoat and a red sleigh, and what do you think",OH

13692,"he takes it in his head to do next?""",OH

13693,"""Chuck-a-luck,"" said Texas, whose ideas of recreation were the gamester's.",OH

13694,"""Come and Kiss Me, Ma Honey,"" sang Shorty, who carried tintypes in his",OH

13696,"""Bought a saloon?"" suggested Thirsty Rogers.",OH

13697,"""Cherokee took me to a room,"" continued Baldy, ""and showed me. He's got",OH

13698,that room full of drums and dolls and skates and bags of candy and jumpingjacks and toy lambs and whistles and such infantile truck. And what do you,OH

13699,think he's goin' to do with them inefficacious knick- knacks? Don't surmise,OH

13700,none--Cherokee told me. He's goin' to lead 'em up in his red sleigh and--wait a,OH

13701,"minute, don't order no drinks yet-- he's goin' to drive down here to",OH

13702,Yellowhammer and give the kids--the kids of this here town--the biggest,OH

13703,Christmas tree and the biggest cryin' doll and Little Giant Boys' Tool Chest,OH

13704,"blowout that was ever seen west of the Cape Hatteras.""",OH

13705,Two minutes of absolute silence ticked away in the wake of Baldy's words. It,OH

13706,"was broken by the House, who, happily conceiving the moment to be ripe for",OH

13707,"extending hospitality, sent a dozen whisky glasses spinning down the bar, with",OH

13708,the slower travelling bottle bringing up the rear.,OH

13709,"""Didn't you tell him?"" asked the miner called Trinidad.",OH

13710,"""Well, no,"" answered Baldy, pensively; ""I never exactly seen my way to.",OH

13711,"""You see, Cherokee had this Christmas mess already bought and paid for; and",OH

13712,he was all flattered up with self-esteem over his idea; and we had in a way,OH

13713,"flew the flume with that fizzy wine I speak of; so I never let on.""",OH

13714,"""I cannot refrain from a certain amount of surprise,"" said the Judge, as he hung",OH

13718,"""Cherokee's been gone from Yellowhammer over seven months. Lots of things",OH

13719,could happen in that time. How's he to know that there ain't a single kid in this,OH

13721,"""Come to think of it,"" remarked California Ed, ""it's funny some ain't drifted in.",OH

13724,"""To top off this Christmas-tree splurge of Cherokee's,"" went on Baldy, ""he's",OH

13725,goin' to give an imitation of Santa Claus. He's got a white wig and whiskers,OH

13726,that disfigure him up exactly like the pictures of this William Cullen,OH

13727,"Longfellow in the books, and a red suit of fur-trimmed outside underwear, and",OH

13728,"eight-ounce gloves, and a stand-up, lay-down croshayed red cap. Ain't it a",OH

13729,shame that a outfit like that can't get a chance to connect with a Annie and,OH

13733,room fixed up and a tree hauled and ready. And such ladies to assist as can,OH

13734,"stop breathin' long enough to let it be a surprise for the kids.""",OH

13735,The unblessed condition of Yellowhammer had been truly described. The,OH

13736,voice of childhood had never gladdened its flimsy structures; the patter of,OH

13737,restless little feet had never consecrated the one rugged highway between the,OH

13738,two rows of tents and rough buildings. Later they would come. But now,OH

13739,"Yellowhammer was but a mountain camp, and nowhere in it were the roguish,",OH

13740,"expectant eyes, opening wide at dawn of the enchanting day; the eager, small",OH

13742,"the season's joy, such as the coming good things of the warm-hearted",OH

13743,Cherokee deserved.,OH

13744,"Of women there were five in Yellowhammer. The assayer's wife, the",OH

13745,"proprietress of the Lucky Strike Hotel, and a laundress whose washtub panned",OH

13748,"Transcontinental Comedy Company, then playing in repertoire at the",OH

13749,(improvised) Empire Theatre. But of children there were none. Sometimes,OH

13750,Miss Fanchon enacted with spirit and address the part of robustious childhood;,OH

13751,but between her delineation and the visions of adolescence that the fancy,OH

13753,fixed a gulf.,OH

13754,"Christmas would come on Thursday. On Tuesday morning Trinidad, instead of",OH

13756,"""It'll be a disgrace to Yellowhammer,"" said Trinidad, ""if it throws Cherokee",OH

13757,down on his Christmas tree blowout. You might say that that man made this,OH

13760,"""My co-operation,"" said the Judge, ""would be gladly forthcoming. I am",OH

13763,"do not see--""",OH

13764,"""Look at me,"" said Trinidad, ""and you'll see old Ways and Means with the fur",OH

13777,to secure a vehicle and team.,OH

13778,The first stop scheduled was at a double log-house fifteen miles out from,OH

13779,"Yellowhammer. A man opened the door at Trinidad's hail, and then came down",OH

13785,folderols that's painted red and made in Germany. The youngest kid we got in,OH

13789,return 'em safe and sound on Christmas Day. And they'll come back loaded,OH

13790,down with a good time and Swiss Family Robinsons and cornucopias and red,OH

13791,"drums and similar testimonials. What do you say?""",OH

13792,"""In other words,"" said the Judge, ""we have discovered for the first time in our",OH

13793,embryonic but progressive little city the inconveniences of the absence of,OH

13794,adolescence. The season of the year having approximately arrived during,OH

13795,which it is a custom to bestow frivolous but often appreciated gifts upon the,OH

13796,"young and tender--""",OH

13797,"""I understand,"" said the parent, packing his pipe with a forefinger. ""I guess I",OH

13798,"needn't detain you gentlemen. Me and the old woman have got seven kids, so",OH

13799,"to speak; and, runnin' my mind over the bunch, I don't appear to hit upon none",OH

13800,that we could spare for you to take over to your doin's. The old woman has got,OH

13801,"some popcorn candy and rag dolls hid in the clothes chest, and we allow to",OH

13802,"give Christmas a little whirl of our own in a insignificant sort of style. No, I",OH

13803,"couldn't, with any degree of avidity, seem to fall in with the idea of lettin' none",OH

13804,"of 'em go. Thank you kindly, gentlemen.""",OH

13805,Down the slope they drove and up another foothill to the ranch-house of Wiley,OH

13806,Wilson. Trinidad recited his appeal and the Judge boomed out his ponderous,OH

13807,antiphony. Mrs. Wiley gathered her two rosy-cheeked youngsters close to her,OH

13808,skirts and did not smile until she had seen Wiley laugh and shake his head.,OH

13809,Again a refusal.,OH

13810,Trinidad and the Judge vainly exhausted more than half their list before,OH

13811,"twilight set in among the hills. They spent the night at a stage road hostelry,",OH

13812,and set out again early the next morning. The wagon had not acquired a single,OH

13813,passenger.,OH

13814,"""It's creepin' upon my faculties,"" remarked Trinidad, ""that borrowin' kids at",OH

13815,Christmas is somethin' like tryin' to steal butter from a man that's got hot,OH

13816,"pancakes a-comin'.""",OH

13817,"""It is undoubtedly an indisputable fact,"" said the Judge, ""that the-- ah--family",OH

13818,"ties seem to be more coherent and assertive at that period of the year.""",OH

13819,"On the day before Christmas they drove thirty miles, making four fruitless",OH

13820,"halts and appeals. Everywhere they found ""kids"" at a premium.",OH

13821,The sun was low when the wife of a section boss on a lonely railroad huddled,OH

13822,her unavailable progeny behind her and said:,OH

13823,"""There's a woman that's just took charge of the railroad eatin' house down at",OH

13824,"Granite Junction. I hear she's got a little boy. Maybe she might let him go.""",OH

13825,Trinidad pulled up his mules at Granite Junction at five o'clock in the,OH

13826,afternoon. The train had just departed with its load of fed and appeased,OH

13827,passengers.,OH

13828,On the steps of the eating house they found a thin and glowering boy of ten,OH

13829,smoking a cigarette. The dining-room had been left in chaos by the peripatetic,OH

13830,"appetites. A youngish woman reclined, exhausted, in a chair. Her face wore",OH

13831,sharp lines of worry. She had once possessed a certain style of beauty that,OH

13832,would never wholly leave her and would never wholly return. Trinidad set,OH

13833,forth his mission.,OH

13834,"""I'd count it a mercy if you'd take Bobby for a while,"" she said, wearily. ""I'm",OH

13835,"on the go from morning till night, and I don't have time to 'tend to him. He's",OH

13836,learning bad habits from the men. It'll be the only chance he'll have to get any,OH

13837,"Christmas.""",OH

13838,The men went outside and conferred with Bobby. Trinidad pictured the glories,OH

13839,of the Christmas tree and presents in lively colours.,OH

13840,"""And, moreover, my young friend,"" added the Judge, ""Santa Claus himself",OH

13841,will personally distribute the offerings that will typify the gifts conveyed by,OH

13842,"the shepherds of Bethlehem to--""",OH

13843,"""Aw, come off,"" said the boy, squinting his small eyes. ""I ain't no kid. There",OH

13844,ain't any Santa Claus. It's your folks that buys toys and sneaks 'em in when,OH

13845,you're asleep. And they make marks in the soot in the chimney with the tongs,OH

13846,"to look like Santa's sleigh tracks.""",OH

13847,"""That might be so,"" argued Trinidad, ""but Christmas trees ain't no fairy tale.",OH

13848,"This one's goin' to look like the ten-cent store in Albuquerque, all strung up in",OH

13849,"a redwood. There's tops and drums and Noah's arks and--""",OH

13850,"""Oh, rats!"" said Bobby, wearily. ""I cut them out long ago. I'd like to have a",OH

13851,"rifle--not a target one--a real one, to shoot wildcats with; but I guess you won't",OH

13852,"have any of them on your old tree.""",OH

13853,"""Well, I can't say for sure,"" said Trinidad diplomatically; ""it might be. You go",OH

13854,"along with us and see.""",OH

13855,"The hope thus held out, though faint, won the boy's hesitating consent to go.",OH

13856,"With this solitary beneficiary for Cherokee's holiday bounty, the canvassers",OH

13857,spun along the homeward road.,OH

13858,In Yellowhammer the empty storeroom had been transformed into what might,OH

13859,have passed as the bower of an Arizona fairy. The ladies had done their work,OH

13860,"well. A tall Christmas tree, covered to the topmost branch with candles,",OH

13861,"spangles, and toys sufficient for more than a score of children, stood in the",OH

13862,centre of the floor. Near sunset anxious eyes had begun to scan the street for,OH

13863,the returning team of the child-providers. At noon that day Cherokee had,OH

13864,dashed into town with his new sleigh piled high with bundles and boxes and,OH

13865,bales of all sizes and shapes. So intent was he upon the arrangements for his,OH

13866,altruistic plans that the dearth of children did not receive his notice. No one,OH

13867,"gave away the humiliating state of Yellowhammer, for the efforts of Trinidad",OH

13868,and the Judge were expected to supply the deficiency.,OH

13869,"When the sun went down Cherokee, with many wings and arch grins on his",OH

13870,"seasoned face, went into retirement with the bundle containing the Santa Claus",OH

13871,raiment and a pack containing special and undisclosed gifts.,OH

13872,"""When the kids are rounded up,"" he instructed the volunteer arrangement",OH

13873,"committee, ""light up the candles on the tree and set 'em to playin' 'Pussy Wants",OH

13874,"a Corner' and 'King William.' When they get good and at it, why--old Santa'll",OH

13875,"slide in the door. I reckon there'll be plenty of gifts to go 'round.""",OH

13876,"The ladies were flitting about the tree, giving it final touches that were never",OH

13877,final. The Spangled Sisters were there in costume as Lady Violet de Vere and,OH

13878,"Marie, the maid, in their new drama, ""The Miner's Bride."" The theatre did not",OH

13879,"open until nine, and they were welcome assistants of the Christmas tree",OH

13880,committee. Every minute heads would pop out the door to look and listen for,OH

13881,"the approach of Trinidad's team. And now this became an anxious function,",OH

13882,for night had fallen and it would soon be necessary to light the candles on the,OH

13883,"tree, and Cherokee was apt to make an irruption at any time in his Kriss",OH

13884,Kringle garb.,OH

13885,"At length the wagon of the child ""rustlers"" rattled down the street to the door.",OH

13886,"The ladies, with little screams of excitement, flew to the lighting of the",OH

13887,candles. The men of Yellowhammer passed in and out restlessly or stood about,OH

13888,the room in embarrassed groups.,OH

13889,"Trinidad and the Judge, bearing the marks of protracted travel, entered,",OH

13890,"conducting between them a single impish boy, who stared with sullen,",OH

13891,pessimistic eyes at the gaudy tree.,OH

13892,"""Where are the other children?"" asked the assayer's wife, the acknowledged",OH

13893,leader of all social functions.,OH

13894,"""Ma'am,"" said Trinidad with a sigh, ""prospectin' for kids at Christmas time is",OH

13895,like huntin' in a limestone for silver. This parental business is one that I haven't,OH

13896,no chance to comprehend. It seems that fathers and mothers are willin' for,OH

13897,"their offsprings to be drownded, stole, fed on poison oak, and et by catamounts",OH

13898,364 days in the year; but on Christmas Day they insists on enjoyin' the,OH

13899,"exclusive mortification of their company. This here young biped, ma'am, is all",OH

13900,"that washes out of our two days' manoeuvres.""",OH

13901,"""Oh, the sweet little boy!"" cooed Miss Erma, trailing her De Vere robes to",OH

13902,centre of stage.,OH

13903,"""Aw, shut up,"" said Bobby, with a scowl. ""Who's a kid? You ain't, you bet.""",OH

13904,"""Fresh brat!"" breathed Miss Erma, beneath her enamelled smile.",OH

13905,"""We done the best we could,"" said Trinidad. ""It's tough on Cherokee, but it",OH

13906,"can't be helped.""",OH

13907,Then the door opened and Cherokee entered in the conventional dress of Saint,OH

13908,Nick. A white rippling beard and flowing hair covered his face almost to his,OH

13909,dark and shining eyes. Over his shoulder he carried a pack.,OH

13910,No one stirred as he came in. Even the Spangler Sisters ceased their coquettish,OH

13911,poses and stared curiously at the tall figure. Bobby stood with his hands in his,OH

13912,pockets gazing gloomily at the effeminate and childish tree. Cherokee put,OH

13913,down his pack and looked wonderingly about the room. Perhaps he fancied,OH

13914,"that a bevy of eager children were being herded somewhere, to be loosed upon",OH

13915,his entrance. He went up to Bobby and extended his red-mittened hand.,OH

13916,"""Merry Christmas, little boy,"" said Cherokee. ""Anything on the tree you want",OH

13917,"they'll get it down for you. Won't you shake hands with Santa Claus?""",OH

13918,"""There ain't any Santa Claus,"" whined the boy. ""You've got old false billy",OH

13919,goat's whiskers on your face. I ain't no kid. What do I want with dolls and tin,OH

13920,"horses? The driver said you'd have a rifle, and you haven't. I want to go",OH

13921,"home.""",OH

13922,Trinidad stepped into the breach. He shook Cherokee's hand in warm greeting.,OH

13923,"""I'm sorry, Cherokee,"" he explained. ""There never was a kid in Yellowhammer.",OH

13924,"We tried to rustle a bunch of 'em for your swaree, but this sardine was all we",OH

13925,"could catch. He's a atheist, and he don't believe in Santa Claus. It's a shame for",OH

13926,you to be out all this truck. But me and the Judge was sure we could round up,OH

13927,"a wagonful of candidates for your gimcracks.""",OH

13928,"""That's all right,"" said Cherokee gravely. ""The expense don't amount to nothin'",OH

13929,worth mentionin'. We can dump the stuff down a shaft or throw it away. I don't,OH

13930,know what I was thinkin' about; but it never occurred to my cogitations that,OH

13931,"there wasn't any kids in Yellowhammer.""",OH

13932,Meanwhile the company had relaxed into a hollow but praiseworthy imitation,OH

13933,of a pleasure gathering.,OH

13934,"Bobby had retreated to a distant chair, and was coldly regarding the scene with",OH

13935,"ennui plastered thick upon him. Cherokee, lingering with his original idea,",OH

13936,went over and sat beside him.,OH

13937,"""Where do you live, little boy?"" he asked respectfully.",OH

13938,"""Granite Junction,"" said Bobby without emphasis.",OH

13939,"The room was warm. Cherokee took off his cap, and then removed his beard",OH

13940,and wig.,OH

13941,"""Say!"" exclaimed Bobby, with a show of interest, ""I know your mug, all right.""",OH

13942,"""Did you ever see me before?"" asked Cherokee.",OH

13950,Cherokee rose and beckoned to Trinidad.,OH

13951,"""Keep this boy by you till I come back,"" he said. ""I'm goin' to shed these",OH

13952,"Christmas duds, and hitch up my sleigh. I'm goin' to take this kid home.""",OH

13953,"""Well, infidel,"" said Trinidad, taking Cherokee's vacant chair, ""and so you are",OH

13954,"too superannuated and effete to yearn for such mockeries as candy and toys, it",OH

13955,"seems.""",OH

13956,"""I don't like you,"" said Bobby, with acrimony. ""You said there would be a rifle.",OH

13957,"A fellow can't even smoke. I wish I was at home.""",OH

13959,The team of fine horses sprang away prancingly over the hard snow. Cherokee,OH

13960,had on his $500 overcoat of baby sealskin. The laprobe that he drew about,OH

13961,them was as warm as velvet.,OH

13962,Bobby slipped a cigarette from his pocket and was trying to snap a match.,OH

13963,"""Throw that cigarette away,"" said Cherokee, in a quiet but new voice.",OH

13964,"Bobby hesitated, and then dropped the cylinder overboard.",OH

13965,"""Throw the box, too,"" commanded the new voice.",OH

13966,More reluctantly the boy obeyed.,OH

13967,"""Say,"" said Bobby, presently, ""I like you. I don't know why. Nobody never",OH

13979,A CHAPARRAL PRINCE,OH

13980,"Nine o'clock at last, and the drudging toil of the day was ended. Lena climbed",OH

13981,to her room in the third half-story of the Quarrymen's Hotel. Since daylight,OH

13982,"she had slaved, doing the work of a full-grown woman, scrubbing the floors,",OH

13983,"washing the heavy ironstone plates and cups, making the beds, and supplying",OH

13984,the insatiate demands for wood and water in that turbulent and depressing,OH

13985,hostelry.,OH

13986,"The din of the day's quarrying was over--the blasting and drilling, the creaking",OH

13987,"of the great cranes, the shouts of the foremen, the backing and shifting of the",OH

13988,flat-cars hauling the heavy blocks of limestone. Down in the hotel office three,OH

13989,or four of the labourers were growling and swearing over a belated game of,OH

13990,"checkers. Heavy odours of stewed meat, hot grease, and cheap coffee hung",OH

13991,like a depressing fog about the house.,OH

13992,Lena lit the stump of a candle and sat limply upon her wooden chair. She was,OH

13993,"eleven years old, thin and ill-nourished. Her back and limbs were sore and",OH

13994,aching. But the ache in her heart made the biggest trouble. The last straw had,OH

13995,been added to the burden upon her small shoulders. They had taken away,OH

13996,"Grimm. Always at night, however tired she might be, she had turned to Grimm",OH

13997,for comfort and hope. Each time had Grimm whispered to her that the prince,OH

13998,or the fairy would come and deliver her out of the wicked enchantment. Every,OH

13999,night she had taken fresh courage and strength from Grimm.,OH

14000,To whatever tale she read she found an analogy in her own condition. The,OH

14001,"woodcutter's lost child, the unhappy goose girl, the persecuted stepdaughter,",OH

14002,the little maiden imprisoned in the witch's hut--all these were but transparent,OH

14003,"disguises for Lena, the overworked kitchenmaid in the Quarrymen's Hotel.",OH

14004,And always when the extremity was direst came the good fairy or the gallant,OH

14005,prince to the rescue.,OH

14006,"So, here in the ogre's castle, enslaved by a wicked spell, Lena had leaned upon",OH

14007,"Grimm and waited, longing for the powers of goodness to prevail. But on the",OH

14008,day before Mrs. Maloney had found the book in her room and had carried it,OH

14009,"away, declaring sharply that it would not do for servants to read at night; they",OH

14010,lost sleep and did not work briskly the next day. Can one only eleven years,OH

14011,"old, living away from one's mamma, and never having any time to play, live",OH

14012,entirely deprived of Grimm? Just try it once and you will see what a difficult,OH

14013,thing it is.,OH

14014,"Lena's home was in Texas, away up among the little mountains on the",OH

14015,"Pedernales River, in a little town called Fredericksburg. They are all German",OH

14016,people who live in Fredericksburg. Of evenings they sit at little tables along,OH

14017,the sidewalk and drink beer and play pinochle and scat. They are very thrifty,OH

14018,people.,OH

14019,"Thriftiest among them was Peter Hildesmuller, Lena's father. And that is why",OH

14020,"Lena was sent to work in the hotel at the quarries, thirty miles away. She",OH

14021,"earned three dollars every week there, and Peter added her wages to his wellguarded store. Peter had an ambition to become as rich as his neighbour, Hugo",OH

14022,"Heffelbauer, who smoked a meerschaum pipe three feet long and had wiener",OH

14023,schnitzel and hassenpfeffer for dinner every day in the week. And now Lena,OH

14024,was quite old enough to work and assist in the accumulation of riches. But,OH

14025,"conjecture, if you can, what it means to be sentenced at eleven years of age",OH

14026,from a home in the pleasant little Rhine village to hard labour in the ogre's,OH

14027,"castle, where you must fly to serve the ogres, while they devour cattle and",OH

14028,"sheep, growling fiercely as they stamp white limestone dust from their great",OH

14029,"shoes for you to sweep and scour with your weak, aching fingers. And then--to",OH

14030,have Grimm taken away from you!,OH

14031,Lena raised the lid of an old empty case that had once contained canned corn,OH

14032,and got out a sheet of paper and a piece of pencil. She was going to write a,OH

14033,letter to her mamma. Tommy Ryan was going to post it for her at Ballinger's.,OH

14034,"Tommy was seventeen, worked in the quarries, went home to Ballinger's every",OH

14035,"night, and was now waiting in the shadows under Lena's window for her to",OH

14036,throw the letter out to him. That was the only way she could send a letter to,OH

14037,Fredericksburg. Mrs. Maloney did not like for her to write letters.,OH

14038,"The stump of the candle was burning low, so Lena hastily bit the wood from",OH

14039,around the lead of her pencil and began. This is the letter she wrote:,OH

14040,Dearest Mamma:--I want so much to see you. And Gretel and Claus,OH

14041,and Heinrich and little Adolf. I am so tired. I want to see you.,OH

14042,To-day I was slapped by Mrs. Maloney and had no supper. I could,OH

14043,"not bring in enough wood, for my hand hurt. She took my book",OH

14044,"yesterday. I mean ""Grimm's Fairy Tales,"" which Uncle Leo gave me.",OH

14045,It did not hurt any one for me to read the book. I try to work as,OH

14046,"well as I can, but there is so much to do. I read only a little",OH

14047,"bit every night. Dear mamma, I shall tell you what I am going to",OH

14048,do. Unless you send for me to-morrow to bring me home I shall go,OH

14049,to a deep place I know in the river and drown. It is wicked to,OH

14050,"drown, I suppose, but I wanted to see you, and there is no one",OH

14051,"else. I am very tired, and Tommy is waiting for the letter. You",OH

14052,"will excuse me, mamma, if I do it.",OH

14053,"Your respectful and loving daughter,",OH

14054,Lena.,OH

14055,"Tommy was still waiting faithfully when the letter was concluded, and when",OH

14056,Lena dropped it out she saw him pick it up and start up the steep hillside.,OH

14057,Without undressing she blew out the candle and curled herself upon the,OH

14058,mattress on the floor.,OH

14059,At 10:30 o'clock old man Ballinger came out of his house in his stocking feet,OH

14060,"and leaned over the gate, smoking his pipe. He looked down the big road,",OH

14061,"white in the moonshine, and rubbed one ankle with the toe of his other foot. It",OH

14062,was time for the Fredericksburg mail to come pattering up the road.,OH

14063,Old man Ballinger had waited only a few minutes when he heard the lively,OH

14064,"hoofbeats of Fritz's team of little black mules, and very soon afterward his",OH

14065,covered spring wagon stood in front of the gate. Fritz's big spectacles flashed,OH

14066,in the moonlight and his tremendous voice shouted a greeting to the,OH

14068,"from the mules, for he always fed them oats at Ballinger's.",OH

14069,While the mules were eating from their feed bags old man Ballinger brought,OH

14070,out the mail sack and threw it into the wagon.,OH

14071,"Fritz Bergmann was a man of three sentiments--or to be more accurate-- four,",OH

14072,the pair of mules deserving to be reckoned individually. Those mules were the,OH

14073,chief interest and joy of his existence. Next came the Emperor of Germany,OH

14074,and Lena Hildesmuller.,OH

14075,"""Tell me,"" said Fritz, when he was ready to start, ""contains the sack a letter to",OH

14076,Frau Hildesmuller from the little Lena at the quarries? One came in the last,OH

14078,"again.""",OH

14079,"""Yes,"" said old man Ballinger, ""thar's a letter for Mrs. Helterskelter, or some",OH

14081,"over thar, you say?""",OH

14090,"Up the road went the little black mules at their steady trot, while Fritz",OH

14091,thundered at them occasional words of endearment and cheer.,OH

14092,These fancies occupied the mind of the mail-carrier until he reached the big,OH

14093,"post oak forest, eight miles from Ballinger's. Here his ruminations were",OH

14094,scattered by the sudden flash and report of pistols and a whooping as if from a,OH

14095,whole tribe of Indians. A band of galloping centaurs closed in around the mail,OH

14096,"wagon. One of them leaned over the front wheel, covered the driver with his",OH

14097,"revolver, and ordered him to stop. Others caught at the bridles of Donder and",OH

14098,Blitzen.,OH

14102,"you're in a stick-up? Reverse your mules and climb out of the cart.""",OH

14103,It is due to the breadth of Hondo Bill's demerit and the largeness of his,OH

14104,achievements to state that the holding up of the Fredericksburg mail was not,OH

14105,perpetrated by way of an exploit. As the lion while in the pursuit of prey,OH

14106,commensurate to his prowess might set a frivolous foot upon a casual rabbit in,OH

14107,"his path, so Hondo Bill and his gang had swooped sportively upon the pacific",OH

14108,transport of Meinherr Fritz.,OH

14109,The real work of their sinister night ride was over. Fritz and his mail bag and,OH

14110,"his mules came as gentle relaxation, grateful after the arduous duties of their",OH

14111,"profession. Twenty miles to the southeast stood a train with a killed engine,",OH

14112,hysterical passengers and a looted express and mail car. That represented the,OH

14113,serious occupation of Hondo Bill and his gang. With a fairly rich prize of,OH

14114,currency and silver the robbers were making a wide detour to the west through,OH

14115,"the less populous country, intending to seek safety in Mexico by means of",OH

14116,some fordable spot on the Rio Grande. The booty from the train had melted,OH

14117,the desperate bushrangers to jovial and happy skylarkers.,OH

14118,"Trembling with outraged dignity and no little personal apprehension, Fritz",OH

14119,climbed out to the road after replacing his suddenly removed spectacles. The,OH

14120,"band had dismounted and were singing, capering, and whooping, thus",OH

14121,expressing their satisfied delight in the life of a jolly outlaw. Rattlesnake,OH

14122,"Rogers, who stood at the heads of the mules, jerked a little too vigorously at",OH

14123,"the rein of the tender-mouthed Donder, who reared and emitted a loud,",OH

14124,"protesting snort of pain. Instantly Fritz, with a scream of anger, flew at the",OH

14125,bulky Rogers and began to assiduously pummel that surprised freebooter with,OH

14126,his fists.,OH

14127,"""Villain!"" shouted Fritz, ""dog, bigstiff! Dot mule he has a soreness by his",OH

14128,"mouth. I vill knock off your shoulders mit your head-- robbermans!""",OH

14130,"""somebody git this here sour-krout off'n me!""",OH

14131,"One of the band yanked Fritz back by the coat-tail, and the woods rang with",OH

14132,Rattlesnake's vociferous comments.,OH

14133,"""The dog-goned little wienerwurst,"" he yelled, amiably. ""He's not so much of a",OH

14134,"skunk, for a Dutchman. Took up for his animile plum quick, didn't he? I like to",OH

14135,"see a man like his hoss, even if it is a mule. The dad-blamed little Limburger",OH

14141,in these mail sacks. I've done some hoss tradin' with these Dutchmen around,OH

14142,"Fredericksburg, and I know the style of the varmints. There's big money goes",OH

14143,through the mails to that town. Them Dutch risk a thousand dollars sent,OH

14144,"wrapped in a piece of paper before they'd pay the banks to handle the money.""",OH

14145,"Hondo Bill, six feet two, gentle of voice and impulsive in action, was dragging",OH

14146,the sacks from the rear of the wagon before Moody had finished his speech. A,OH

14147,"knife shone in his hand, and they heard the ripping sound as it bit through the",OH

14148,tough canvas. The outlaws crowded around and began tearing open letters and,OH

14149,"packages, enlivening their labours by swearing affably at the writers, who",OH

14150,seemed to have conspired to confute the prediction of Ben Moody. Not a,OH

14151,dollar was found in the Fredericksburg mail.,OH

14152,"""You ought to be ashamed of yourself,"" said Hondo Bill to the mail- carrier in",OH

14153,"solemn tones, ""to be packing around such a lot of old, trashy paper as this.",OH

14154,"What d'you mean by it, anyhow? Where do you Dutchers keep your money",OH

14155,"at?""",OH

14156,The Ballinger mail sack opened like a cocoon under Hondo's knife. It,OH

14157,contained but a handful of mail. Fritz had been fuming with terror and,OH

14158,excitement until this sack was reached. He now remembered Lena's letter. He,OH

14159,"addressed the leader of the band, asking that that particular missive be spared.",OH

14160,"""Much obliged, Dutch,"" he said to the disturbed carrier. ""I guess that's the",OH

14161,"letter we want. Got spondulicks in it, ain't it? Here she is. Make a light, boys.""",OH

14162,Hondo found and tore open the letter to Mrs. Hildesmuller. The others stood,OH

14163,"about, lighting twisted up letters one from another. Hondo gazed with mute",OH

14164,disapproval at the single sheet of paper covered with the angular German,OH

14165,script.,OH

14166,"""Whatever is this you've humbugged us with, Dutchy? You call this here a",OH

14169,"""That's Chiny writin',"" said Sandy Grundy, peering over Hondo's shoulder.",OH

14171,"covered with silk handkerchiefs and nickel plating. ""That's shorthand. I see",OH

14172,"'em do it once in court.""",OH

14173,"""Ach, no, no, no--dot is German,"" said Fritz. ""It is no more as a little girl",OH

14174,"writing a letter to her mamma. One poor little girl, sick and vorking hard avay",OH

14175,"from home. Ach! it is a shame. Good Mr. Robberman, you vill please let me",OH

14179,"possessed of sufficient politeness for to take an interest in the miss's health, are",OH

14182,Hondo twirled his six-shooter by its trigger guard and stood towering above,OH

14183,"the little German, who at once began to read the letter, translating the simple",OH

14184,"words into English. The gang of rovers stood in absolute silence, listening",OH

14185,intently.,OH

14186,"""How old is that kid?"" asked Hondo when the letter was done.",OH

14187,"""Eleven,"" said Fritz.",OH

14188,"""And where is she at?""",OH

14197,"Hondo Bill parleyed aside briefly with his band, and then they seized Fritz and",OH

14198,conveyed him off the road to one side. Here they bound him fast to a tree with,OH

14199,a couple of lariats. His team they tied to another tree near by.,OH

14200,"""We ain't going to hurt you bad,"" said Hondo reassuringly. ""'Twon't hurt you to",OH

14201,"be tied up for a while. We will now pass you the time of day, as it is up to us to",OH

14202,"depart. Ausgespielt--nixcumrous, Dutchy. Don't get any more impatience.""",OH

14203,Fritz heard a great squeaking of saddles as the men mounted their horses. Then,OH

14204,a loud yell and a great clatter of hoofs as they galloped pell-mell back along,OH

14205,the Fredericksburg road.,OH

14206,"For more than two hours Fritz sat against his tree, tightly but not painfully",OH

14207,bound. Then from the reaction after his exciting adventure he sank into,OH

14208,"slumber. How long he slept he knew not, but he was at last awakened by a",OH

14209,"rough shake. Hands were untying his ropes. He was lifted to his feet, dazed,",OH

14210,"confused in mind, and weary of body. Rubbing his eyes, he looked and saw",OH

14211,that he was again in the midst of the same band of terrible bandits. They,OH

14212,shoved him up to the seat of his wagon and placed the lines in his hands.,OH

14213,"""Hit it out for home, Dutch,"" said Hondo Bill's voice commandingly. ""You've",OH

14214,given us lots of trouble and we're pleased to see the back of your neck. Spiel!,OH

14215,"Zwei bier! Vamoose!""",OH

14216,Hondo reached out and gave Blitzen a smart cut with his quirt.,OH

14217,"The little mules sprang ahead, glad to be moving again. Fritz urged them",OH

14218,"along, himself dizzy and muddled over his fearful adventure.",OH

14219,"According to schedule time, he should have reached Fredericksburg at",OH

14220,"daylight. As it was, he drove down the long street of the town at eleven o'clock",OH

14221,A.M. He had to pass Peter Hildesmuller's house on his way to the post-office.,OH

14222,He stopped his team at the gate and called. But Frau Hildesmuller was,OH

14223,watching for him. Out rushed the whole family of Hildesmullers.,OH

14224,"Frau Hildesmuller, fat and flushed, inquired if he had a letter from Lena, and",OH

14225,then Fritz raised his voice and told the tale of his adventure. He told the,OH

14226,"contents of that letter that the robber had made him read, and then Frau",OH

14227,Hildesmuller broke into wild weeping. Her little Lena drown herself! Why had,OH

14228,they sent her from home? What could be done? Perhaps it would be too late by,OH

14229,the time they could send for her now. Peter Hildesmuller dropped his,OH

14230,meerschaum on the walk and it shivered into pieces.,OH

14231,"""Woman!"" he roared at his wife, ""why did you let that child go away? It is",OH

14232,"your fault if she comes home to us no more.""",OH

14233,"Every one knew that it was Peter Hildesmuller's fault, so they paid no",OH

14234,attention to his words.,OH

14235,"A moment afterward a strange, faint voice was heard to call: ""Mamma!"" Frau",OH

14236,"Hildesmuller at first thought it was Lena's spirit calling, and then she rushed to",OH

14237,"the rear of Fritz's covered wagon, and, with a loud shriek of joy, caught up",OH

14238,"Lena herself, covering her pale little face with kisses and smothering her with",OH

14239,"hugs. Lena's eyes were heavy with the deep slumber of exhaustion, but she",OH

14240,smiled and lay close to the one she had longed to see. There among the mail,OH

14241,"sacks, covered in a nest of strange blankets and comforters, she had lain asleep",OH

14242,until wakened by the voices around her.,OH

14243,Fritz stared at her with eyes that bulged behind his spectacles.,OH

14244,"""Gott in Himmel!"" he shouted. ""How did you get in that wagon? Am I going",OH

14245,"crazy as well as to be murdered and hanged by robbers this day?""",OH

14246,"""You brought her to us, Fritz,"" cried Frau Hildesmuller. ""How can we ever",OH

14247,"thank you enough?""",OH

14248,"""Tell mamma how you came in Fritz's wagon,"" said Frau Hildesmuller.",OH

14249,"""I don't know,"" said Lena. ""But I know how I got away from the hotel. The",OH

14250,"Prince brought me.""",OH

14251,"""By the Emperor's crown!"" shouted Fritz, ""we are all going crazy.""",OH

14252,"""I always knew he would come,"" said Lena, sitting down on her bundle of",OH

14253,"bedclothes on the sidewalk. ""Last night he came with his armed knights and",OH

14254,captured the ogre's castle. They broke the dishes and kicked down the doors.,OH

14255,They pitched Mr. Maloney into a barrel of rain water and threw flour all over,OH

14256,Mrs. Maloney. The workmen in the hotel jumped out of the windows and ran,OH

14257,into the woods when the knights began firing their guns. They wakened me up,OH

14258,and I peeped down the stair. And then the Prince came up and wrapped me in,OH

14259,the bedclothes and carried me out. He was so tall and strong and fine. His face,OH

14260,"was as rough as a scrubbing brush, and he talked soft and kind and smelled of",OH

14261,schnapps. He took me on his horse before him and we rode away among the,OH

14262,"knights. He held me close and I went to sleep that way, and didn't wake up till",OH

14263,"I got home.""",OH

14269,XIX,OH

14270,THE REFORMATION OF CALLIOPE,OH

14271,Calliope Catesby was in his humours again. Ennui was upon him. This goodly,OH

14272,"promontory, the earth--particularly that portion of it known as Quicksand--was",OH

14273,to him no more than a pestilent congregation of vapours. Overtaken by the,OH

14274,"megrims, the philosopher may seek relief in soliloquy; my lady find solace in",OH

14275,tears; the flaccid Easterner scold at the millinery bills of his women folk. Such,OH

14276,"recourse was insufficient to the denizens of Quicksand. Calliope, especially,",OH

14277,was wont to express his ennui according to his lights.,OH

14278,Over night Calliope had hung out signals of approaching low spirits. He had,OH

14279,"kicked his own dog on the porch of the Occidental Hotel, and refused to",OH

14280,apologise. He had become capricious and fault-finding in conversation. While,OH

14281,strolling about he reached often for twigs of mesquite and chewed the leaves,OH

14282,fiercely. That was always an ominous act. Another symptom alarming to those,OH

14283,who were familiar with the different stages of his doldrums was his increasing,OH

14284,politeness and a tendency to use formal phrases. A husky softness succeeded,OH

14285,the usual penetrating drawl in his tones. A dangerous courtesy marked his,OH

14286,"manners. Later, his smile became crooked, the left side of his mouth slanting",OH

14287,"upward, and Quicksand got ready to stand from under.",OH

14288,"At this stage Calliope generally began to drink. Finally, about midnight, he",OH

14289,"was seen going homeward, saluting those whom he met with exaggerated but",OH

14290,inoffensive courtesy. Not yet was Calliope's melancholy at the danger point.,OH

14291,He would seat himself at the window of the room he occupied over Silvester's,OH

14292,tonsorial parlours and there chant lugubrious and tuneless ballads until,OH

14293,"morning, accompanying the noises by appropriate maltreatment of a jangling",OH

14294,"guitar. More magnanimous than Nero, he would thus give musical warning of",OH

14295,the forthcoming municipal upheaval that Quicksand was scheduled to endure.,OH

14296,"A quiet, amiable man was Calliope Catesby at other times--quiet to indolence,",OH

14297,and amiable to worthlessness. At best he was a loafer and a nuisance; at worst,OH

14298,he was the Terror of Quicksand. His ostensible occupation was something,OH

14299,subordinate in the real estate line; he drove the beguiled Easterner in,OH

14300,buckboards out to look over lots and ranch property. Originally he came from,OH

14301,"one of the Gulf States, his lank six feet, slurring rhythm of speech, and",OH

14302,sectional idioms giving evidence of his birthplace.,OH

14303,"And yet, after taking on Western adjustments, this languid pine-box whittler,",OH

14304,"cracker barrel hugger, shady corner lounger of the cotton fields and sumac",OH

14305,hills of the South became famed as a bad man among men who had made a,OH

14306,life-long study of the art of truculence.,OH

14307,At nine the next morning Calliope was fit. Inspired by his own barbarous,OH

14308,"melodies and the contents of his jug, he was ready primed to gather fresh",OH

14309,laurels from the diffident brow of Quicksand. Encircled and criss-crossed with,OH

14310,"cartridge belts, abundantly garnished with revolvers, and copiously drunk, he",OH

14311,poured forth into Quicksand's main street. Too chivalrous to surprise and,OH

14312,"capture a town by silent sortie, he paused at the nearest corner and emitted his",OH

14313,"slogan--that fearful, brassy yell, so reminiscent of the steam piano, that had",OH

14314,gained for him the classic appellation that had superseded his own baptismal,OH

14315,"name. Following close upon his vociferation came three shots from his fortyfive by way of limbering up the guns and testing his aim. A yellow dog, the",OH

14316,"personal property of Colonel Swazey, the proprietor of the Occidental, fell feet",OH

14317,upward in the dust with one farewell yelp. A Mexican who was crossing the,OH

14318,"street from the Blue Front grocery carrying in his hand a bottle of kerosene,",OH

14319,"was stimulated to a sudden and admirable burst of speed, still grasping the",OH

14320,neck of the shattered bottle. The new gilt weather-cock on Judge Riley's lemon,OH

14321,"and ultramarine two-story residence shivered, flapped, and hung by a splinter,",OH

14322,the sport of the wanton breezes.,OH

14323,"The artillery was in trim. Calliope's hand was steady. The high, calm ecstasy",OH

14324,"of habitual battle was upon him, though slightly embittered by the sadness of",OH

14325,Alexander in that his conquests were limited to the small world of Quicksand.,OH

14326,"Down the street went Calliope, shooting right and left. Glass fell like hail;",OH

14327,"dogs vamosed; chickens flew, squawking; feminine voices shrieked",OH

14328,concernedly to youngsters at large. The din was perforated at intervals by the,OH

14329,"/staccato/ of the Terror's guns, and was drowned periodically by the brazen",OH

14330,screech that Quicksand knew so well. The occasions of Calliope's low spirits,OH

14331,were legal holidays in Quicksand. All along the main street in advance of his,OH

14332,coming clerks were putting up shutters and closing doors. Business would,OH

14333,"languish for a space. The right of way was Calliope's, and as he advanced,",OH

14334,"observing the dearth of opposition and the few opportunities for distraction,",OH

14335,his ennui perceptibly increased.,OH

14336,But some four squares farther down lively preparations were being made to,OH

14337,minister to Mr. Catesby's love for interchange of compliments and repartee.,OH

14338,On the previous night numerous messengers had hastened to advise Buck,OH

14339,"Patterson, the city marshal, of Calliope's impending eruption. The patience of",OH

14340,"that official, often strained in extending leniency toward the disturber's",OH

14341,"misdeeds, had been overtaxed. In Quicksand some indulgence was accorded",OH

14342,the natural ebullition of human nature. Providing that the lives of the more,OH

14343,"useful citizens were not recklessly squandered, or too much property",OH

14344,"needlessly laid waste, the community sentiment was against a too strict",OH

14345,enforcement of the law. But Calliope had raised the limit. His outbursts had,OH

14346,been too frequent and too violent to come within the classification of a normal,OH

14347,and sanitary relaxation of spirit.,OH

14348,Buck Patterson had been expecting and awaiting in his little ten-by- twelve,OH

14349,frame office that preliminary yell announcing that Calliope was feeling blue.,OH

14350,When the signal came the city marshal rose to his feet and buckled on his,OH

14351,guns. Two deputy sheriffs and three citizens who had proven the edible,OH

14352,"qualities of fire also stood up, ready to bandy with Calliope's leaden",OH

14353,jocularities.,OH

14354,"""Gather that fellow in,"" said Buck Patterson, setting forth the lines of the",OH

14355,"campaign. ""Don't have no talk, but shoot as soon as you can get a show. Keep",OH

14356,behind cover and bring him down. He's a nogood 'un. It's up to Calliope to,OH

14357,"turn up his toes this time, I reckon. Go to him all spraddled out, boys. And",OH

14358,"don't git too reckless, for what Calliope shoots at he hits.""",OH

14359,"Buck Patterson, tall, muscular, and solemn-faced, with his bright ""City",OH

14360,"Marshal"" badge shining on the breast of his blue flannel shirt, gave his posse",OH

14361,directions for the onslaught upon Calliope. The plan was to accomplish the,OH

14362,"downfall of the Quicksand Terror without loss to the attacking party, if",OH

14363,possible.,OH

14364,"The splenetic Calliope, unconscious of retributive plots, was steaming down",OH

14365,"the channel, cannonading on either side, when he suddenly became aware of",OH

14366,breakers ahead. The city marshal and one of the deputies rose up behind some,OH

14367,dry-goods boxes half a square to the front and opened fire. At the same time,OH

14368,"the rest of the posse, divided, shelled him from two side streets up which they",OH

14369,were cautiously manoeuvring from a well-executed detour.,OH

14370,"The first volley broke the lock of one of Calliope's guns, cut a neat underbit in",OH

14371,"his right ear, and exploded a cartridge in his crossbelt, scorching his ribs as it",OH

14372,"burst. Feeling braced up by this unexpected tonic to his spiritual depression,",OH

14373,"Calliope executed a fortissimo note from his upper register, and returned the",OH

14374,"fire like an echo. The upholders of the law dodged at his flash, but a trifle too",OH

14375,"late to save one of the deputies a bullet just above the elbow, and the marshal a",OH

14376,bleeding cheek from a splinter that a ball tore from the box he had ducked,OH

14377,behind.,OH

14378,And now Calliope met the enemy's tactics in kind. Choosing with a rapid eye,OH

14379,"the street from which the weakest and least accurate fire had come, he invaded",OH

14380,"it at a double-quick, abandoning the unprotected middle of the street. With",OH

14381,rare cunning the opposing force in that direction--one of the deputies and two,OH

14382,"of the valorous volunteers-- waited, concealed by beer barrels, until Calliope",OH

14383,"had passed their retreat, and then peppered him from the rear. In another",OH

14384,"moment they were reinforced by the marshal and his other men, and then",OH

14385,Calliope felt that in order to successfully prolong the delights of the,OH

14386,controversy he must find some means of reducing the great odds against him.,OH

14387,"His eye fell upon a structure that seemed to hold out this promise, providing",OH

14388,he could reach it.,OH

14389,"Not far away was the little railroad station, its building a strong box house, ten",OH

14390,"by twenty feet, resting upon a platform four feet above ground. Windows were",OH

14391,in each of its walls. Something like a fort it might become to a man thus sorely,OH

14392,pressed by superior numbers.,OH

14393,"Calliope made a bold and rapid spurt for it, the marshal's crowd ""smoking""",OH

14394,"him as he ran. He reached the haven in safety, the station agent leaving the",OH

14395,"building by a window, like a flying squirrel, as the garrison entered the door.",OH

14396,Patterson and his supporters halted under protection of a pile of lumber and,OH

14397,held consultations. In the station was an unterrified desperado who was an,OH

14398,excellent shot and carried an abundance of ammunition. For thirty yards on,OH

14399,"either side of the besieged was a stretch of bare, open ground. It was a sure",OH

14400,thing that the man who attempted to enter that unprotected area would be,OH

14401,stopped by one of Calliope's bullets.,OH

14402,The city marshal was resolved. He had decided that Calliope Catesby should,OH

14403,no more wake the echoes of Quicksand with his strident whoop. He had so,OH

14404,announced. Officially and personally he felt imperatively bound to put the soft,OH

14405,pedal on that instrument of discord. It played bad tunes.,OH

14406,Standing near was a hand truck used in the manipulation of small freight. It,OH

14407,"stood by a shed full of sacked wool, a consignment from one of the sheep",OH

14408,ranches. On this truck the marshal and his men piled three heavy sacks of,OH

14409,"wool. Stooping low, Buck Patterson started for Calliope's fort, slowly pushing",OH

14410,"this loaded truck before him for protection. The posse, scattering broadly,",OH

14411,stood ready to nip the besieged in case he should show himself in an effort to,OH

14412,repel the juggernaut of justice that was creeping upon him. Only once did,OH

14413,"Calliope make demonstration. He fired from a window, and some tufts of wool",OH

14414,spurted from the marshal's trustworthy bulwark. The return shots from the,OH

14415,posse pattered against the window frame of the fort. No loss resulted on either,OH

14416,side.,OH

14417,The marshal was too deeply engrossed in steering his protected battleship to,OH

14418,be aware of the approach of the morning train until he was within a few feet of,OH

14419,the platform. The train was coming up on the other side of it. It stopped only,OH

14420,one minute at Quicksand. What an opportunity it would offer to Calliope! He,OH

14421,"had only to step out the other door, mount the train, and away.",OH

14422,"Abandoning his breastwork, Buck, with his gun ready, dashed up the steps and",OH

14423,"into the room, driving upon the closed door with one heave of his weighty",OH

14424,"shoulder. The members of the posse heard one shot fired inside, and then there",OH

14425,was silence.,OH

14426,At length the wounded man opened his eyes. After a blank space he again,OH

14427,"could see and hear and feel and think. Turning his eyes about, he found",OH

14428,"himself lying on a wooden bench. A tall man with a perplexed countenance,",OH

14429,"wearing a big badge with ""City Marshal"" engraved upon it, stood over him. A",OH

14430,"little old woman in black, with a wrinkled face and sparkling black eyes, was",OH

14431,holding a wet handkerchief against one of his temples. He was trying to get,OH

14432,"these facts fixed in his mind and connected with past events, when the old",OH

14433,woman began to talk.,OH

14434,"""There now, great, big, strong man! That bullet never tetched ye! Jest skeeted",OH

14435,along the side of your head and sort of paralysed ye for a spell. I've heerd of,OH

14436,sech things afore; cun-cussion is what they names it. Abel Wadkins used to,OH

14437,"kill squirrels that way--barkin' 'em, Abe called it. You jest been barked, sir,",OH

14438,"and you'll be all right in a little bit. Feel lots better already, don't ye! You just",OH

14439,"lay still a while longer and let me bathe your head. You don't know me, I",OH

14440,"reckon, and 'tain't surprisin' that you shouldn't. I come in on that train from",OH

14441,"Alabama to see my son. Big son, ain't he? Lands! you wouldn't hardly think",OH

14442,"he'd ever been a baby, would ye? This is my son, sir.""",OH

14443,"Half turning, the old woman looked up at the standing man, her worn face",OH

14444,lighting with a proud and wonderful smile. She reached out one veined and,OH

14445,calloused hand and took one of her son's. Then smiling cheerily down at the,OH

14446,"prostrate man, she continued to dip the handkerchief, in the waiting-room tin",OH

14447,washbasin and gently apply it to his temple. She had the benevolent garrulity,OH

14448,of old age.,OH

14449,"""I ain't seen my son before,"" she continued, ""in eight years. One of my",OH

14450,"nephews, Elkanah Price, he's a conductor on one of them railroads and he got",OH

14451,"me a pass to come out here. I can stay a whole week on it, and then it'll take",OH

14452,"me back again. Jest think, now, that little boy of mine has got to be a officer--a",OH

14453,"city marshal of a whole town! That's somethin' like a constable, ain't it? I",OH

14454,never knowed he was a officer; he didn't say nothin' about it in his letters. I,OH

14455,"reckon he thought his old mother'd be skeered about the danger he was in. But,",OH

14456,laws! I never was much of a hand to git skeered. 'Tain't no use. I heard them,OH

14457,"guns a-shootin' while I was gettin' off them cars, and I see smoke a-comin' out",OH

14458,"of the depot, but I jest walked right along. Then I see son's face lookin' out",OH

14459,"through the window. I knowed him at oncet. He met me at the door, and",OH

14460,"squeezes me 'most to death. And there you was, sir, a-lyin' there jest like you",OH

14461,"was dead, and I 'lowed we'd see what might be done to help sot you up.""",OH

14462,"""I think I'll sit up now,"" said the concussion patient. ""I'm feeling pretty fair by",OH

14463,"this time.""",OH

14464,"He sat, somewhat weakly yet, leaning against the wall. He was a rugged man,",OH

14465,"big-boned and straight. His eyes, steady and keen, seemed to linger upon the",OH

14466,face of the man standing so still above him. His look wandered often from the,OH

14467,face he studied to the marshal's badge upon the other's breast.,OH

14468,"""Yes, yes, you'll be all right,"" said the old woman, patting his arm, ""if you",OH

14469,"don't get to cuttin' up agin, and havin' folks shooting at you. Son told me about",OH

14470,"you, sir, while you was layin' senseless on the floor. Don't you take it as",OH

14471,meddlesome fer an old woman with a son as big as you to talk about it. And,OH

14472,you mustn't hold no grudge ag'in' my son for havin' to shoot at ye. A officer,OH

14473,has got to take up for the law--it's his duty--and them that acts bad and lives,OH

14474,"wrong has to suffer. Don't blame my son any, sir--'tain't his fault. He's always",OH

14475,"been a good boy--good when he was growin' up, and kind and 'bedient and",OH

14476,"well-behaved. Won't you let me advise you, sir, not to do so no more? Be a",OH

14477,"good man, and leave liquor alone and live peaceably and goodly. Keep away",OH

14478,"from bad company and work honest and sleep sweet.""",OH

14479,The black-mitted hand of the old pleader gently touched the breast of the man,OH

14480,"she addressed. Very earnest and candid her old, worn face looked. In her rusty",OH

14481,"black dress and antique bonnet she sat, near the close of a long life, and",OH

14482,epitomised the experience of the world. Still the man to whom she spoke,OH

14483,"gazed above her head, contemplating the silent son of the old mother.",OH

14484,"""What does the marshal say?"" he asked. ""Does he believe the advice is good?",OH

14485,"Suppose the marshal speaks up and says if the talk's all right?""",OH

14486,The tall man moved uneasily. He fingered the badge on his breast for a,OH

14487,"moment, and then he put an arm around the old woman and drew her close to",OH

14488,"him. She smiled the unchanging mother smile of three-score years, and patted",OH

14489,"his big brown hand with her crooked, mittened fingers while her son spake.",OH

14490,"""I says this,"" he said, looking squarely into the eyes of the other man, ""that if I",OH

14491,"was in your place I'd follow it. If I was a drunken, desp'rate character, without",OH

14492,"shame or hope, I'd follow it. If I was in your place and you was in mine I'd",OH

14493,"say: 'Marshal, I'm willin' to swear if you'll give me the chance I'll quit the",OH

14494,"racket. I'll drop the tanglefoot and the gun play, and won't play hoss no more.",OH

14495,I'll be a good citizen and go to work and quit my foolishness. So help me,OH

14496,"God!' That's what I'd say to you if you was marshal and I was in your place.""",OH

14497,"""Hear my son talkin',"" said the old woman softly. ""Hear him, sir. You promise",OH

14498,to be good and he won't do you no harm. Forty-one year ago his heart first,OH

14499,"beat ag'in' mine, and it's beat true ever since.""",OH

14500,"The other man rose to his feet, trying his limbs and stretching his muscles.",OH

14504,forget that trunk of mine! I see a man settin' it on the platform jest as I seen,OH

14505,"son's face in the window, and it went plum out of my head. There's eight jars",OH

14506,of home-made quince jam in that trunk that I made myself. I wouldn't have,OH

14567,"adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the impression that it is a form",OW

14572,"except, of course, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his",OW

14573,"parents in a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a fairhaired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself for",OW

14574,American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for three,OW

14575,"successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an excellent",OW

14576,dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses. Otherwise he,OW

14577,"was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little girl of fifteen, lithe",OW

14578,"and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes. She was a",OW

14579,"wonderful Amazon, and had once raced old Lord Bilton on her pony twice",OW

14606,"was a large stained glass window. Here they found tea laid out for them, and,",OW

14607,"after taking off their wraps, they sat down and began to look round, while Mrs.",OW

14608,Umney waited on them.,OW

14609,Suddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by the,OW

14610,"fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said to Mrs.",OW

14611,"Umney, ""I am afraid something has been spilt there.""",OW

14612,"""Yes, madam,"" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, ""blood has been",OW

14613,"spilt on that spot.""",OW

14614,"""How horrid!"" cried Mrs. Otis; ""I don't at all care for blood-stains in a",OW

14615,"sitting-room. It must be removed at once.""",OW

14616,"The old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,",OW

14617,"""It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that",OW

14618,"very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575. Sir Simon",OW

14619,"survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious",OW

14620,"circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his guilty spirit still",OW

14621,haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much admired by tourists and,OW

14622,"others, and cannot be removed.""",OW

14623,"""That is all nonsense,"" cried Washington Otis; ""Pinkerton's Champion",OW

14624,"Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,"" and before",OW

14625,"the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his knees, and",OW

14626,was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what looked like a black,OW

14627,cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the blood-stain could be seen.,OW

14628,"""I knew Pinkerton would do it,"" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he looked",OW

14629,round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these words than a,OW

14630,"terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a fearful peal of thunder",OW

14631,"made them all start to their feet, and Mrs. Umney fainted.",OW

14632,"""What a monstrous climate!"" said the American Minister, calmly, as he lit",OW

14633,"a long cheroot. ""I guess the old country is so overpopulated that they have not",OW

14634,enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of opinion that,OW

14635,"emigration is the only thing for England.""",OW

14636,"""My dear Hiram,"" cried Mrs. Otis, ""what can we do with a woman who",OW

14637,"faints?""",OW

14638,"""Charge it to her like breakages,"" answered the Minister; ""she won't faint",OW

14639,"after that;"" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to. There was",OW

14640,"no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she sternly warned Mr.",OW

14641,Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.,OW

14642,"""I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,"" she said, ""that would make any",OW

14643,"Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not closed my",OW

14644,"eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here."" Mr. Otis, however, and",OW

14645,"his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they were not afraid of ghosts,",OW

14646,"and, after invoking the blessings of Providence on her new master and",OW

14647,"mistress, and making arrangements for an increase of salary, the old",OW

14648,housekeeper tottered off to her own room.,OW

14649,II,OW

14650,"The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note",OW

14651,"occurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,",OW

14652,"they found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. ""I don't think it",OW

14653,"can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,"" said Washington, ""for I have tried it",OW

14654,"with everything. It must be the ghost."" He accordingly rubbed out the stain a",OW

14655,"second time, but the second morning it appeared again. The third morning also",OW

14656,"it was there, though the library had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis",OW

14657,"himself, and the key carried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite",OW

14658,interested; Mr. Otis began to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his,OW

14659,"denial of the existence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining",OW

14660,"the Psychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs. Myers",OW

14661,and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when,OW

14662,connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective existence of,OW

14663,phantasmata were removed for ever.,OW

14664,"The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the",OW

14665,"whole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine o'clock,",OW

14666,"when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts,",OW

14667,so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectations,OW

14668,which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena. The subjects,OW

14669,"discussed, as I have since learned from Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the",OW

14670,"ordinary conversation of cultured Americans of the better class, such as the",OW

14671,immense superiority of Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an,OW

14672,"actress; the difficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy,",OW

14673,even in the best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development,OW

14674,of the world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway,OW

14675,travelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the,OW

14676,"London drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was Sir",OW

14677,Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the family,OW

14678,"retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time after, Mr. Otis was",OW

14679,"awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside his room. It sounded like",OW

14680,"the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming nearer every moment. He got up",OW

14681,"at once, struck a match, and looked at the time. It was exactly one o'clock. He",OW

14682,"was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange",OW

14683,"noise still continued, and with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He",OW

14684,"put on his slippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and",OW

14685,"opened the door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old",OW

14686,man of terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair fell,OW

14687,"over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of antique cut,",OW

14688,"were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung heavy manacles",OW

14689,and rusty gyves.,OW

14690,"""My dear sir,"" said Mr. Otis, ""I really must insist on your oiling those",OW

14691,"chains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the Tammany",OW

14692,Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious upon one,OW

14693,"application, and there are several testimonials to that effect on the wrapper",OW

14694,from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall leave it here for you by,OW

14695,"the bedroom candles, and will be happy to supply you with more, should you",OW

14696,"require it."" With these words the United States Minister laid the bottle down",OW

14697,"on a marble table, and, closing his door, retired to rest.",OW

14698,For a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural,OW

14699,"indignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor, he fled",OW

14700,"down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a ghastly green light.",OW

14701,"Just, however, as he reached the top of the great oak staircase, a door was",OW

14702,"flung open, two little white-robed figures appeared, and a large pillow whizzed",OW

14703,"past his head! There was evidently no time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the",OW

14704,"Fourth dimension of Space as a means of escape, he vanished through the",OW

14705,"wainscoting, and the house became quite quiet.",OW

14706,"On reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up against a",OW

14707,"moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize his position.",OW

14708,"Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three hundred years, had he",OW

14709,"been so grossly insulted. He thought of the Dowager Duchess, whom he had",OW

14710,frightened into a fit as she stood before the glass in her lace and diamonds; of,OW

14711,"the four housemaids, who had gone into hysterics when he merely grinned at",OW

14712,them through the curtains on one of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the,OW

14713,"parish, whose candle he had blown out as he was coming late one night from",OW

14714,"the library, and who had been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a",OW

14715,"perfect martyr to nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who,",OW

14716,having wakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an,OW

14717,"armchair by the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six",OW

14718,"weeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become",OW

14719,"reconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that notorious",OW

14720,"sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible night when the",OW

14721,"wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his dressing-room, with the",OW

14722,"knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and confessed, just before he",OW

14723,"died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox out of �50,000 at Crockford's by",OW

14724,"means of that very card, and swore that the ghost had made him swallow it.",OW

14725,"All his great achievements came back to him again, from the butler who had",OW

14726,shot himself in the pantry because he had seen a green hand tapping at the,OW

14727,"window-pane, to the beautiful Lady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear",OW

14728,a black velvet band round her throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt,OW

14729,"upon her white skin, and who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the",OW

14730,"end of the King's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he",OW

14731,"went over his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as",OW

14732,"he recalled to mind his last appearance as ""Red Reuben, or the Strangled",OW

14733,"Babe,"" his d�but as ""Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,"" and",OW

14734,the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely playing ninepins,OW

14735,with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And after all this some,OW

14736,wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him the Rising Sun,OW

14737,"Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite unbearable. Besides, no",OW

14738,"ghost in history had ever been treated in this manner. Accordingly, he",OW

14739,"determined to have vengeance, and remained till daylight in an attitude of",OW

14740,deep thought.,OW

14741,III,OW

14742,"The next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed",OW

14743,the ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a little,OW

14744,"annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. ""I have no wish,"" he",OW

14745,"said, ""to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say that, considering the",OW

14746,"length of time he has been in the house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw",OW

14747,"pillows at him,""�a very just remark, at which, I am sorry to say, the twins",OW

14748,"burst into shouts of laughter. ""Upon the other hand,"" he continued, ""if he really",OW

14749,"declines to use the Rising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains",OW

14750,"from him. It would be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on",OW

14751,"outside the bedrooms.""",OW

14752,"For the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing",OW

14753,that excited any attention being the continual renewal of the blood-stain on the,OW

14754,"library floor. This certainly was very strange, as the door was always locked at",OW

14755,"night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept closely barred. The chameleon-like",OW

14756,"colour, also, of the stain excited a good deal of comment. Some mornings it",OW

14757,"was a dull (almost Indian) red, then it would be vermilion, then a rich purple,",OW

14758,"and once when they came down for family prayers, according to the simple",OW

14759,"rites of the Free American Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a",OW

14760,bright emerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party,OW

14761,"very much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The only",OW

14762,"person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who, for some",OW

14763,"unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the sight of the",OW

14764,"blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was emerald-green.",OW

14765,The second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after,OW

14766,they had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the hall.,OW

14767,"Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old armour had become",OW

14768,"detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone floor, while seated in a",OW

14769,"high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost, rubbing his knees with an",OW

14770,"expression of acute agony on his face. The twins, having brought their peashooters with them, at once discharged two pellets on him, with that accuracy",OW

14771,"of aim which can only be attained by long and careful practice on a writingmaster, while the United States Minister covered him with his revolver, and",OW

14772,"called upon him, in accordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his",OW

14773,"hands! The ghost started up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through",OW

14774,"them like a mist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so",OW

14775,leaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase he,OW

14776,"recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of demoniac",OW

14777,laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely useful. It,OW

14778,"was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single night, and had",OW

14779,certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French governesses give warning,OW

14780,"before their month was up. He accordingly laughed his most horrible laugh,",OW

14781,"till the old vaulted roof rang and rang again, but hardly had the fearful echo",OW

14782,"died away when a door opened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue",OW

14783,"dressing-gown. ""I am afraid you are far from well,"" she said, ""and have",OW

14784,"brought you a bottle of Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will",OW

14785,"find it a most excellent remedy."" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at",OW

14786,"once to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an",OW

14787,"accomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family",OW

14788,"doctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's uncle, the",OW

14789,"Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps, however, made",OW

14790,"him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself with becoming faintly",OW

14791,"phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep churchyard groan, just as the twins",OW

14792,had come up to him.,OW

14793,"On reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the",OW

14794,"most violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross materialism of",OW

14795,"Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what really distressed him",OW

14796,most was that he had been unable to wear the suit of mail. He had hoped that,OW

14797,"even modern Americans would be thrilled by the sight of a Spectre in armour,",OW

14798,"if for no more sensible reason, at least out of respect for their natural poet",OW

14799,"Longfellow, over whose graceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled",OW

14800,away many a weary hour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it,OW

14801,was his own suit. He had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth,OW

14802,"tournament, and had been highly complimented on it by no less a person than",OW

14803,"the Virgin Queen herself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely",OW

14804,"overpowered by the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had",OW

14805,"fallen heavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and",OW

14806,bruising the knuckles of his right hand.,OW

14807,"For some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of his",OW

14808,"room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair. However, by",OW

14809,"taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to make a third",OW

14810,attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his family. He selected,OW

14811,"Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent most of that day in looking",OW

14812,"over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in favour of a large slouched hat with a",OW

14813,"red feather, a winding-sheet frilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger.",OW

14814,"Towards evening a violent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high",OW

14815,"that all the windows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it",OW

14816,was just such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to make,OW

14817,"his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the foot of the",OW

14818,"bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound of low music. He",OW

14819,"bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware that it was he who was in",OW

14820,the habit of removing the famous Canterville blood-stain by means of,OW

14821,Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced the reckless and foolhardy,OW

14822,"youth to a condition of abject terror, he was then to proceed to the room",OW

14823,"occupied by the United States Minister and his wife, and there to place a",OW

14824,"clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead, while he hissed into her trembling",OW

14825,husband's ear the awful secrets of the charnel-house. With regard to little,OW

14826,"Virginia, he had not quite made up his mind. She had never insulted him in",OW

14827,"any way, and was pretty and gentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe,",OW

14828,"he thought, would be more than sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he",OW

14829,might grabble at the counterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the,OW

14830,"twins, he was quite determined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be",OW

14831,"done was, of course, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling",OW

14832,"sensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each other, to",OW

14833,"stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse, till they became",OW

14834,"paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the winding-sheet, and crawl",OW

14835,"round the room, with white, bleached bones and one rolling eyeball, in the",OW

14836,"character of ""Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's Skeleton,"" a r�le in which he had",OW

14837,"on more than one occasion produced a great effect, and which he considered",OW

14838,"quite equal to his famous part of ""Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.""",OW

14839,**,OW

14840,At half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was,OW

14841,"disturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the light-",OW

14842,"hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves before they",OW

14843,"retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still, and, as midnight",OW

14844,"sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the window-panes, the raven",OW

14845,"croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind wandered moaning round the",OW

14846,"house like a lost soul; but the Otis family slept unconscious of their doom, and",OW

14847,high above the rain and storm he could hear the steady snoring of the Minister,OW

14848,"for the United States. He stepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil",OW

14849,"smile on his cruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he",OW

14850,"stole past the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his",OW

14851,"murdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like an",OW

14852,"evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed. Once he",OW

14853,"thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only the baying of a",OW

14854,"dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange sixteenth-century",OW

14855,"curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger in the midnight air.",OW

14856,Finally he reached the corner of the passage that led to luckless Washington's,OW

14857,"room. For a moment he paused there, the wind blowing his long grey locks",OW

14858,"about his head, and twisting into grotesque and fantastic folds the nameless",OW

14859,"horror of the dead man's shroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt",OW

14860,"the time was come. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no",OW

14861,"sooner had he done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid",OW

14862,"his blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was standing a",OW

14863,"horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous as a madman's",OW

14864,"dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round, and fat, and white; and",OW

14865,hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its features into an eternal grin. From,OW

14866,"the eyes streamed rays of scarlet light, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a",OW

14867,"hideous garment, like to his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form.",OW

14868,"On its breast was a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some",OW

14869,"scroll of shame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of",OW

14870,"crime, and, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.",OW

14871,"Never having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened, and,",OW

14872,"after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to his room,",OW

14873,"tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the corridor, and finally",OW

14874,"dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's jack-boots, where it was found in",OW

14875,"the morning by the butler. Once in the privacy of his own apartment, he flung",OW

14876,"himself down on a small pallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a",OW

14877,"time, however, the brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he",OW

14878,determined to go and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight.,OW

14879,"Accordingly, just as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned",OW

14880,"towards the spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling",OW

14881,"that, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid of his new",OW

14882,"friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching the spot, however,",OW

14883,"a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had evidently happened to the spectre,",OW

14884,"for the light had entirely faded from its hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had",OW

14885,"fallen from its hand, and it was leaning up against the wall in a strained and",OW

14886,"uncomfortable attitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to",OW

14887,"his horror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a",OW

14888,"recumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity bed-curtain,",OW

14889,"with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow turnip lying at his feet!",OW

14890,"Unable to understand this curious transformation, he clutched the placard with",OW

14891,"feverish haste, and there, in the grey morning light, he read these fearful",OW

14892,words:�,OW

14893,YE OTIS GHOSTE,OW

14894,"Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook,",OW

14895,Beware of Ye Imitationes.,OW

14896,All others are counterfeite.,OW

14897,"The whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and outwitted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his toothless",OW

14898,"gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his head, swore",OW

14899,"according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique school, that, when",OW

14900,"Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds of blood would be",OW

14901,"wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.",OW

14902,"Hardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of a",OW

14903,"distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh, and",OW

14904,"waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange reason, did",OW

14905,"not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of the housemaids made",OW

14906,"him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back to his room, thinking of his",OW

14907,vain oath and baffled purpose. There he consulted several books of ancient,OW

14908,"chivalry, of which he was exceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion",OW

14909,"on which this oath had been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second",OW

14910,"time. ""Perdition seize the naughty fowl,"" he muttered, ""I have seen the day",OW

14911,"when, with my stout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made",OW

14912,"him crow for me an 'twere in death!"" He then retired to a comfortable lead",OW

14913,"coffin, and stayed there till evening.",OW

14914,IV,OW

14915,The next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement of,OW

14916,the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were,OW

14917,"completely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five days he",OW

14918,"kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point of the blood-",OW

14919,"stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want it, they clearly did not",OW

14920,"deserve it. They were evidently people on a low, material plane of existence,",OW

14921,and quite incapable of appreciating the symbolic value of sensuous,OW

14922,"phenomena. The question of phantasmic apparitions, and the development of",OW

14923,"astral bodies, was of course quite a different matter, and really not under his",OW

14924,"control. It was his solemn duty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to",OW

14925,gibber from the large oriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every,OW

14926,"month, and he did not see how he could honourably escape from his",OW

14927,"obligations. It is quite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other",OW

14928,"hand, he was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.",OW

14929,"For the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as usual",OW

14930,"between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible precaution against",OW

14931,"being either heard or seen. He removed his boots, trod as lightly as possible on",OW

14932,"the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large black velvet cloak, and was careful to",OW

14933,use the Rising Sun Lubricator for oiling his chains. I am bound to,OW

14934,acknowledge that it was with a good deal of difficulty that he brought himself,OW

14935,"to adopt this last mode of protection. However, one night, while the family",OW

14936,"were at dinner, he slipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle.",OW

14937,"He felt a little humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see",OW

14938,"that there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a certain degree,",OW

14939,it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he was not left unmolested.,OW

14940,"Strings were continually being stretched across the corridor, over which he",OW

14941,"tripped in the dark, and on one occasion, while dressed for the part of ""Black",OW

14942,"Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley Woods,"" he met with a severe fall, through",OW

14943,"treading on a butter-slide, which the twins had constructed from the entrance",OW

14944,of the Tapestry Chamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so,OW

14945,"enraged him, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and",OW

14946,"social position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the next",OW

14947,"night in his celebrated character of ""Reckless Rupert, or the Headless Earl.""",OW

14948,"He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact,",OW

14949,"not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that",OW

14950,she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord Canterville's,OW

14951,"grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome Jack Castletown,",OW

14952,declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to marry into a family,OW

14953,that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at,OW

14954,twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by Lord Canterville on,OW

14955,"Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken heart at Tunbridge",OW

14956,"Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it had been a great success. It",OW

14957,"was, however an extremely difficult ""make-up,"" if I may use such a theatrical",OW

14958,expression in connection with one of the greatest mysteries of the,OW

14959,"supernatural, or, to employ a more scientific term, the higher-natural world,",OW

14960,and it took him fully three hours to make his preparations. At last everything,OW

14961,"was ready, and he was very pleased with his appearance. The big leather",OW

14962,"riding-boots that went with the dress were just a little too large for him, and he",OW

14963,"could only find one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite",OW

14964,"satisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting and crept",OW

14965,"down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins, which I",OW

14966,"should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of the colour of",OW

14967,"its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make an effective",OW

14968,"entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water fell right down on",OW

14969,"him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his left shoulder by a couple of",OW

14970,inches. At the same moment he heard stifled shrieks of laughter proceeding,OW

14971,from the four-post bed. The shock to his nervous system was so great that he,OW

14972,"fled back to his room as hard as he could go, and the next day he was laid up",OW

14973,with a severe cold. The only thing that at all consoled him in the whole affair,OW

14974,"was the fact that he had not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the",OW

14975,consequences might have been very serious.,OW

14976,"He now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,",OW

14977,"and contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in list",OW

14978,"slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of draughts, and a",OW

14979,"small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the twins. The final blow he",OW

14980,received occurred on the 19th of September. He had gone down-stairs to the,OW

14981,"great entrance-hall, feeling sure that there, at any rate, he would be quite",OW

14982,"unmolested, and was amusing himself by making satirical remarks on the large",OW

14983,Saroni photographs of the United States Minister and his wife which had now,OW

14984,taken the place of the Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly,OW

14985,"clad in a long shroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with",OW

14986,"a strip of yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In fact,",OW

14987,"he was dressed for the character of ""Jonas the Graveless, or the CorpseSnatcher of Chertsey Barn,"" one of his most remarkable impersonations, and",OW

14988,"one which the Cantervilles had every reason to remember, as it was the real",OW

14989,"origin of their quarrel with their neighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a",OW

14990,"quarter-past two o'clock in the morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no",OW

14991,"one was stirring. As he was strolling towards the library, however, to see if",OW

14992,"there were any traces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him",OW

14993,"from a dark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their",OW

14994,"heads, and shrieked out ""BOO!"" in his ear.",OW

14995,"Seized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural, he",OW

14996,"rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him there with",OW

14997,"the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his enemies on every",OW

14998,"side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the great iron stove, which,",OW

14999,"fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to make his way home through the",OW

15000,"flues and chimneys, arriving at his own room in a terrible state of dirt,",OW

15001,"disorder, and despair.",OW

15002,After this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins lay,OW

15003,"in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with nutshells",OW

15004,"every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the servants, but it was",OW

15005,of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings were so wounded that he,OW

15006,would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed his great work on the history,OW

15007,"of the Democratic Party, on which he had been engaged for some years; Mrs.",OW

15008,"Otis organized a wonderful clam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the",OW

15009,"boys took to lacrosse euchre, poker, and other American national games, and",OW

15010,"Virginia rode about the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of",OW

15011,"Cheshire, who had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville",OW

15012,"Chase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in fact,",OW

15013,"Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who, in reply,",OW

15014,"expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best congratulations to",OW

15015,the Minister's worthy wife.,OW

15016,"The Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the house,",OW

15017,"and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let matters rest,",OW

15018,particularly as he heard that among the guests was the young Duke of,OW

15019,"Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had once bet a hundred",OW

15020,guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice with the Canterville,OW

15021,"ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the floor of the card-room in",OW

15022,"such a helpless paralytic state that, though he lived on to a great age, he was",OW

15023,"never able to say anything again but ""Double Sixes."" The story was well",OW

15024,"known at the time, though, of course, out of respect to the feelings of the two",OW

15025,"noble families, every attempt was made to hush it up, and a full account of all",OW

15026,the circumstances connected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord,OW

15027,"Tattle's Recollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,",OW

15028,was naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence over the,OW

15029,"Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his own first cousin",OW

15030,"having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de Bulkeley, from whom,",OW

15031,"as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are lineally descended.",OW

15032,"Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to Virginia's little lover in",OW

15033,"his celebrated impersonation of ""The Vampire Monk, or the Bloodless",OW

15034,"Benedictine,"" a performance so horrible that when old Lady Startup saw it,",OW

15035,"which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in the year 1764, she went off into",OW

15036,"the most piercing shrieks, which culminated in violent apoplexy, and died in",OW

15037,"three days, after disinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations,",OW

15038,"and leaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,",OW

15039,"however, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the little",OW

15040,Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal,OW

15041,"Bedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.",OW

15042,V,OW

15043,"A few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out riding",OW

15044,"on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting through a",OW

15045,"hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go up by the back",OW

15046,"staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past the Tapestry Chamber,",OW

15047,"the door of which happened to be open, she fancied she saw some one inside,",OW

15048,"and thinking it was her mother's maid, who sometimes used to bring her work",OW

15049,"there, looked in to ask her to mend her habit. To her immense surprise,",OW

15050,"however, it was the Canterville Ghost himself! He was sitting by the window,",OW

15051,"watching the ruined gold of the yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red",OW

15052,leaves dancing madly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his,OW

15053,"hand, and his whole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so",OW

15054,"forlorn, and so much out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first",OW

15055,"idea had been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,",OW

15056,"and determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so deep",OW

15057,"his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she spoke to him.",OW

15058,"""I am so sorry for you,"" she said, ""but my brothers are going back to Eton",OW

15059,"to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy you.""",OW

15060,"""It is absurd asking me to behave myself,"" he answered, looking round in",OW

15061,"astonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him, ""quite",OW

15062,"absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and walk about at",OW

15063,"night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for existing.""",OW

15064,"""It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very",OW

15065,"wicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had killed",OW

15066,"your wife.""",OW

15067,"""Well, I quite admit it,"" said the Ghost, petulantly, ""but it was a purely",OW

15068,"family matter, and concerned no one else.""",OW

15069,"""It is very wrong to kill any one,"" said Virginia, who at times had a sweet",OW

15070,"puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.",OW

15071,"""Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very plain,",OW

15072,"never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about cookery. Why,",OW

15073,"there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent pricket, and do",OW

15074,"you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is no matter now, for it is",OW

15075,"all over, and I don't think it was very nice of her brothers to starve me to death,",OW

15076,"though I did kill her.""",OW

15077,"""Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost�I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry?",OW

15079,"""No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you, all the",OW

15082,"""Stop!"" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, ""it is you who are rude, and",OW

15083,"horrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the paints out of",OW

15084,my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain in the library. First,OW

15085,"you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and I couldn't do any more",OW

15086,"sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the chrome-yellow, and finally I",OW

15087,"had nothing left but indigo and Chinese white, and could only do moonlight",OW

15088,"scenes, which are always depressing to look at, and not at all easy to paint. I",OW

15089,"never told on you, though I was very much annoyed, and it was most",OW

15090,"ridiculous, the whole thing; for who ever heard of emerald-green blood?""",OW

15091,"""Well, really,"" said the Ghost, rather meekly, ""what was I to do? It is a very",OW

15092,"difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother began it all",OW

15093,"with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I should not have",OW

15094,"your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of taste: the Cantervilles",OW

15095,"have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest in England; but I know you",OW

15096,"Americans don't care for things of this kind.""",OW

15097,"""You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate",OW

15101,"Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I know lots of people",OW

15104,"""I don't think I should like America.""",OW

15105,"""I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,"" said Virginia,",OW

15106,satirically.,OW

15150,And peace come to Canterville.',OW

15152,"""They mean,"" he said, sadly, ""that you must weep with me for my sins,",OW

15158,"Virginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as",OW

15159,"he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very pale,",OW

15160,"and with a strange light in her eyes. ""I am not afraid,"" she said firmly, ""and I",OW

15161,"will ask the angel to have mercy on you.""",OW

15162,"He rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent over",OW

15163,"it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold as ice, and",OW

15164,"his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as he led her across the",OW

15165,dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were broidered little huntsmen. They,OW

15166,blew their tasselled horns and with their tiny hands waved to her to go back.,OW

15167,"""Go back! little Virginia,"" they cried, ""go back!"" but the ghost clutched her",OW

15168,"hand more tightly, and she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with",OW

15169,"lizard tails and goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and",OW

15170,"murmured, ""Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,"" but",OW

15171,"the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When they",OW

15172,"reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she could",OW

15173,"not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly fading away",OW

15174,"like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A bitter cold wind swept",OW

15175,"round them, and she felt something pulling at her dress. ""Quick, quick,"" cried",OW

15176,"the Ghost, ""or it will be too late,"" and in a moment the wainscoting had closed",OW

15177,"behind them, and the Tapestry Chamber was empty.",OW

15178,VI,OW

15179,"About ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not come",OW

15180,"down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a little time he",OW

15181,returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia anywhere. As she was in,OW

15182,the habit of going out to the garden every evening to get flowers for the,OW

15183,"dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all alarmed at first, but when six o'clock",OW

15184,"struck, and Virginia did not appear, she became really agitated, and sent the",OW

15185,"boys out to look for her, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in",OW

15186,the house. At half-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no,OW

15187,trace of their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of,OW

15188,"excitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly",OW

15189,"remembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies",OW

15190,permission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for Blackfell,OW

15191,"Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son and two of",OW

15192,"the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was perfectly frantic with",OW

15193,"anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too, but Mr. Otis would not allow",OW

15194,"him, as he was afraid there might be a scuffle. On arriving at the spot,",OW

15195,"however, he found that the gipsies had gone, and it was evident that their",OW

15196,"departure had been rather sudden, as the fire was still burning, and some plates",OW

15197,were lying on the grass. Having sent off Washington and the two men to scour,OW

15198,"the district, he ran home, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors",OW

15199,"in the county, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been kidnapped",OW

15200,"by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought round, and, after",OW

15201,"insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down to dinner, rode off down",OW

15202,"the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly, however, gone a couple of miles,",OW

15203,"when he heard somebody galloping after him, and, looking round, saw the",OW

15204,"little Duke coming up on his pony, with his face very flushed, and no hat. ""I'm",OW

15205,"awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,"" gasped out the boy, ""but I can't eat any dinner as long",OW

15206,as Virginia is lost. Please don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged,OW

15207,"last year, there would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me",OW

15208,"back, will you? I can't go! I won't go!""",OW

15209,"The Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,",OW

15210,"and was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down from",OW

15211,"his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, ""Well, Cecil, if you",OW

15212,"won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must get you a hat at",OW

15213,"Ascot.""",OW

15214,"""Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!"" cried the little Duke, laughing, and",OW

15215,they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of the stationmaster if any one answering to the description of Virginia had been seen on,OW

15216,"the platform, but could get no news of her. The station-master, however, wired",OW

15217,"up and down the line, and assured him that a strict watch would be kept for",OW

15218,"her, and, after having bought a hat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who",OW

15219,"was just putting up his shutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about",OW

15220,"four miles away, which he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as",OW

15221,"there was a large common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman,",OW

15222,"but could get no information from him, and, after riding all over the common,",OW

15223,"they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase about",OW

15224,"eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found Washington",OW

15225,"and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with lanterns, as the avenue",OW

15226,was very dark. Not the slightest trace of Virginia had been discovered. The,OW

15227,"gipsies had been caught on Brockley meadows, but she was not with them,",OW

15228,and they had explained their sudden departure by saying that they had,OW

15229,"mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and had gone off in a hurry for fear they",OW

15230,"should be late. Indeed, they had been quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's",OW

15231,"disappearance, as they were very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them",OW

15232,"to camp in his park, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the",OW

15233,"search. The carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly",OW

15234,"gone over, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any rate,",OW

15235,Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest depression that,OW

15236,"Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom following behind",OW

15237,with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they found a group of frightened,OW

15238,"servants, and lying on a sofa in the library was poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of",OW

15239,"her mind with terror and anxiety, and having her forehead bathed with eau de",OW

15240,cologne by the old housekeeper. Mr. Otis at once insisted on her having,OW

15241,"something to eat, and ordered up supper for the whole party. It was a",OW

15242,"melancholy meal, as hardly any one spoke, and even the twins were awestruck",OW

15243,"and subdued, as they were very fond of their sister. When they had finished,",OW

15244,"Mr. Otis, in spite of the entreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed,",OW

15245,"saying that nothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph",OW

15246,in the morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down,OW

15247,"immediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight began",OW

15248,"to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded they heard a",OW

15249,"crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder shook the house, a",OW

15250,"strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a panel at the top of the",OW

15251,"staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out on the landing, looking very",OW

15252,"pale and white, with a little casket in her hand, stepped Virginia. In a moment",OW

15253,"they had all rushed up to her. Mrs. Otis clasped her passionately in her arms,",OW

15254,"the Duke smothered her with violent kisses, and the twins executed a wild",OW

15255,war-dance round the group.,OW

15256,"""Good heavens! child, where have you been?"" said Mr. Otis, rather angrily,",OW

15257,"thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them. ""Cecil and I",OW

15258,"have been riding all over the country looking for you, and your mother has",OW

15259,"been frightened to death. You must never play these practical jokes any more.""",OW

15260,"""Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!"" shrieked the twins, as they",OW

15261,capered about.,OW

15262,"""My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side",OW

15263,"again,"" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and smoothed",OW

15264,the tangled gold of her hair.,OW

15265,"""Papa,"" said Virginia, quietly, ""I have been with the Ghost. He is dead, and",OW

15266,"you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was really sorry",OW

15267,"for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of beautiful jewels before he",OW

15268,"died.""",OW

15269,"The whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave",OW

15270,"and serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the",OW

15271,"wainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a",OW

15272,"lighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they came to a",OW

15273,"great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia touched it, it swung",OW

15274,"back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves in a little low room, with",OW

15275,"a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated window. Imbedded in the wall was a",OW

15276,"huge iron ring, and chained to it was a gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at",OW

15277,"full length on the stone floor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long",OW

15278,"fleshless fingers an old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out",OW

15279,"of its reach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was",OW

15280,covered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but a pile,OW

15281,"of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding her little hands",OW

15282,"together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the party looked on in wonder",OW

15283,at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now disclosed to them.,OW

15284,"""Hallo!"" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out",OW

15285,of the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was,OW

15286,"situated. ""Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see the",OW

15287,"flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.""",OW

15288,"""God has forgiven him,"" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet, and",OW

15289,a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.,OW

15290,"""What an angel you are!"" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round",OW

15291,"her neck, and kissed her.",OW

15292,VII,OW

15293,"Four days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from Canterville",OW

15294,Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn by eight black,OW

15295,"horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of nodding ostrichplumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich purple pall, on which was",OW

15296,embroidered in gold the Canterville coat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse,OW

15297,"and the coaches walked the servants with lighted torches, and the whole",OW

15298,procession was wonderfully impressive. Lord Canterville was the chief,OW

15299,"mourner, having come up specially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in",OW

15300,the first carriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States,OW

15301,"Minister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the last",OW

15302,"carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had been frightened",OW

15303,"by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she had a right to see the last",OW

15304,"of him. A deep grave had been dug in the corner of the churchyard, just under",OW

15305,"the old yew-tree, and the service was read in the most impressive manner by",OW

15306,"the Rev. Augustus Dampier. When the ceremony was over, the servants,",OW

15307,"according to an old custom observed in the Canterville family, extinguished",OW

15308,"their torches, and, as the coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia",OW

15309,"stepped forward, and laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almondblossoms. As she did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded",OW

15310,"with its silent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a",OW

15311,nightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the Garden,OW

15312,"of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a word during",OW

15313,the drive home.,OW

15314,"The next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had",OW

15315,an interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given to,OW

15316,"Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby necklace",OW

15317,"with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen of sixteenthcentury work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis felt considerable",OW

15318,scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.,OW

15319,"""My lord,"" he said, ""I know that in this country mortmain is held to apply",OW

15320,"to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that these jewels are, or",OW

15321,"should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg you, accordingly, to take them",OW

15322,"to London with you, and to regard them simply as a portion of your property",OW

15323,which has been restored to you under certain strange conditions. As for my,OW

15324,"daughter, she is merely a child, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little",OW

15325,"interest in such appurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis,",OW

15326,"who, I may say, is no mean authority upon Art,�having had the privilege of",OW

15327,"spending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,�that these gems are",OW

15328,"of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall price. Under",OW

15329,"these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you will recognize how",OW

15330,impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain in the possession of any,OW

15331,"member of my family; and, indeed, all such vain gauds and toys, however",OW

15332,"suitable or necessary to the dignity of the British aristocracy, would be",OW

15333,"completely out of place among those who have been brought up on the severe,",OW

15334,"and I believe immortal, principles of Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should",OW

15335,mention that Virginia is very anxious that you should allow her to retain the,OW

15336,"box, as a memento of your unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is",OW

15337,"extremely old, and consequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps",OW

15338,"think fit to comply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good",OW

15339,deal surprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi�valism,OW

15340,"in any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was born in",OW

15341,one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned from a trip to,OW

15342,"Athens.""",OW

15343,"Lord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,",OW

15344,"pulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile, and",OW

15345,"when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and said: ""My",OW

15346,"dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky ancestor, Sir",OW

15347,"Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are much indebted to her",OW

15348,"for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels are clearly hers, and, egad, I",OW

15349,"believe that if I were heartless enough to take them from her, the wicked old",OW

15350,"fellow would be out of his grave in a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life.",OW

15351,"As for their being heirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned",OW

15352,"in a will or legal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite",OW

15353,"unknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and",OW

15354,"when Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have pretty",OW

15355,"things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the furniture and",OW

15356,"the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at once",OW

15357,"into your possession, as, whatever activity Sir Simon may have shown in the",OW

15358,"corridor at night, in point of law he was really dead, and you acquired his",OW

15359,"property by purchase.""",OW

15360,"Mr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and",OW

15361,"begged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was quite",OW

15362,"firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to retain the",OW

15363,"present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of 1890, the young",OW

15364,Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first drawing-room on the,OW

15365,"occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the universal theme of admiration.",OW

15366,"For Virginia received the coronet, which is the reward of all good little",OW

15367,"American girls, and was married to her boy-lover as soon as he came of age.",OW

15368,"They were both so charming, and they loved each other so much, that every",OW

15369,"one was delighted at the match, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton,",OW

15370,"who had tried to catch the Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and",OW

15371,"had given no less than three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and,",OW

15372,"strange to say, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young",OW

15373,"Duke personally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his own",OW

15374,"words, ""was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating influences of a",OW

15375,"pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of Republican simplicity should",OW

15376,"be forgotten."" His objections, however, were completely overruled, and I",OW

15377,"believe that when he walked up the aisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with",OW

15378,"his daughter leaning on his arm, there was not a prouder man in the whole",OW

15379,length and breadth of England.,OW

15380,"The Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to",OW

15381,"Canterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over in the",OW

15382,afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had been a great,OW

15383,"deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir Simon's tombstone, but",OW

15384,finally it had been decided to engrave on it simply the initials of the old,OW

15385,"gentleman's name, and the verse from the library window. The Duchess had",OW

15386,"brought with her some lovely roses, which she strewed upon the grave, and",OW

15387,after they had stood by it for some time they strolled into the ruined chancel of,OW

15388,"the old abbey. There the Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her",OW

15389,husband lay at her feet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful,OW

15390,"eyes. Suddenly he threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to",OW

15420,creeps down through the thickly-muffled glass of the small iron-barred,OW

15421,window beneath which one sits is grey and niggard. It is always twilight in,OW

15422,"one�s cell, as it is always twilight in one�s heart. And in the sphere of thought,",OW

15423,"no less than in the sphere of time, motion is no more. The thing that you",OW

15424,"personally have long ago forgotten, or can easily forget, is happening to me",OW

15425,"now, and will happen to me again to-morrow. Remember this, and you will be",OW

15426,"able to understand a little of why I am writing, and in this manner writing. . . .",OW

15427,"A week later, I am transferred here. Three more months go over and my",OW

15428,mother dies. No one knew how deeply I loved and honoured her. Her death,OW

15429,"was terrible to me; but I, once a lord of language, have no words in which to",OW

15430,express my anguish and my shame. She and my father had bequeathed me a,OW

15431,"name they had made noble and honoured, not merely in literature, art,",OW

15432,"archaeology, and science, but in the public history of my own country, in its",OW

15433,evolution as a nation. I had disgraced that name eternally. I had made it a low,OW

15434,by-word among low people. I had dragged it through the very mire. I had,OW

15435,"given it to brutes that they might make it brutal, and to fools that they might",OW

15436,"turn it into a synonym for folly. What I suffered then, and still suffer, is not for",OW

15437,"pen to write or paper to record. My wife, always kind and gentle to me, rather",OW

15438,"than that I should hear the news from indifferent lips, travelled, ill as she was,",OW

15439,all the way from Genoa to England to break to me herself the tidings of so,OW

15440,"irreparable, so irremediable, a loss. Messages of sympathy reached me from",OW

15441,all who had still affection for me. Even people who had not known me,OW

15442,"personally, hearing that a new sorrow had broken into my life, wrote to ask",OW

15443,that some expression of their condolence should be conveyed to me. . . .,OW

15444,Three months go over. The calendar of my daily conduct and labour,OW

15445,that,OW

15446,"hangs on the outside of my cell door, with my name and sentence written upon",OW

15447,"it, tells me that it is May. . . .",OW

15448,"Prosperity, pleasure and success, may be rough of grain and common in fibre,",OW

15449,but sorrow is the most sensitive of all created things. There is nothing that,OW

15450,stirs in the whole world of thought to which sorrow does not vibrate in terrible,OW

15451,and exquisite pulsation. The thin beaten-out leaf of tremulous gold that,OW

15452,chronicles the direction of forces the eye cannot see is in comparison coarse. It,OW

15453,"is a wound that bleeds when any hand but that of love touches it, and even",OW

15454,"then must bleed again, though not in pain.",OW

15455,Where there is sorrow there is holy ground. Some day people will realise,OW

15456,"what that means. They will know nothing of life till they do,�and natures",OW

15457,like his can realise it. When I was brought down from my prison to the Court,OW

15458,"of Bankruptcy, between two policemen,�waited in the long dreary corridor",OW

15459,"that, before the whole crowd, whom an action so sweet and simple hushed into",OW

15460,"silence, he might gravely raise his hat to me, as, handcuffed and with bowed",OW

15461,"head, I passed him by. Men have gone to heaven for smaller things than that.",OW

15462,"It was in this spirit, and with this mode of love, that the saints knelt down to",OW

15463,"wash the feet of the poor, or stooped to kiss the leper on the cheek. I have",OW

15464,never said one single word to him about what he did. I do not know to the,OW

15465,present moment whether he is aware that I was even conscious of his action.,OW

15466,It is not a thing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words. I,OW

15467,store it in the treasure-house of my heart. I keep it there as a secret debt that I,OW

15468,am glad to think I can never possibly repay. It is embalmed and kept sweet by,OW

15469,"the myrrh and cassia of many tears. When wisdom has been profitless to me,",OW

15470,"philosophy barren, and the proverbs and phrases of those who have sought to",OW

15471,"give me consolation as dust and ashes in my mouth, the memory of that little,",OW

15472,"lovely, silent act of love has unsealed for me all the wells of pity: made the",OW

15473,"desert blossom like a rose, and brought me out of the bitterness of lonely exile",OW

15474,"into harmony with the wounded, broken, and great heart of the world. When",OW

15475,"people are able to understand, not merely how beautiful ---�s action was, but",OW

15476,"why it meant so much to me, and always will mean so much, then, perhaps,",OW

15477,they will realise how and in what spirit they should approach me. . . .,OW

15478,"The poor are wise, more charitable, more kind, more sensitive than we are. In",OW

15479,"their eyes prison is a tragedy in a man�s life, a misfortune, a casuality,",OW

15480,something that calls for sympathy in others. They speak of one who is in,OW

15481,"prison as of one who is �in trouble� simply. It is the phrase they always use,",OW

15482,and the expression has the perfect wisdom of love in it. With people of our,OW

15483,"own rank it is different. With us, prison makes a man a pariah. I, and such as I",OW

15484,"am, have hardly any right to air and sun. Our presence taints the pleasures of",OW

15485,others. We are unwelcome when we reappear. To revisit the glimpses of the,OW

15486,moon is not for us. Our very children are taken away. Those lovely links with,OW

15487,"humanity are broken. We are doomed to be solitary, while our sons still live.",OW

15488,"We are denied the one thing that might heal us and keep us, that might bring",OW

15489,"balm to the bruised heart, and peace to the soul in pain. . . .",OW

15490,"I must say to myself that I ruined myself, and that nobody great or small can",OW

15491,be ruined except by his own hand. I am quite ready to say so. I am trying to,OW

15492,"say so, though they may not think it at the present moment. This pitiless",OW

15493,indictment I bring without pity against myself. Terrible as was what the world,OW

15494,"did to me, what I did to myself was far more terrible still.",OW

15495,I was a man who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age.,OW

15496,"I had realised this for myself at the very dawn of my manhood, and had forced",OW

15497,my age to realise it afterwards. Few men hold such a position in their own,OW

15498,"lifetime, and have it so acknowledged. It is usually discerned, if discerned at",OW

15499,"all, by the historian, or the critic, long after both the man and his age have",OW

15500,"passed away. With me it was different. I felt it myself, and made others feel",OW

15501,"it. Byron was a symbolic figure, but his relations were to the passion of his",OW

15502,"age and its weariness of passion. Mine were to something more noble, more",OW

15503,"permanent, of more vital issue, of larger scope.",OW

15504,The gods had given me almost everything. But I let myself be lured into long,OW

15505,"spells of senseless and sensual ease. I amused myself with being afl�neur, a",OW

15506,"dandy, a man of fashion. I surrounded myself with the smaller natures and the",OW

15507,"meaner minds. I became the spendthrift of my own genius, and to waste an",OW

15508,"eternal youth gave me a curious joy. Tired of being on the heights, I",OW

15509,deliberately went to the depths in the search for new sensation. What the,OW

15510,"paradox was to me in the sphere of thought, perversity became to me in the",OW

15511,"sphere of passion. Desire, at the end, was a malady, or a madness, or both. I",OW

15512,"grew careless of the lives of others. I took pleasure where it pleased me, and",OW

15513,passed on. I forgot that every little action of the common day makes or,OW

15514,"unmakes character, and that therefore what one has done in the secret chamber",OW

15515,one has some day to cry aloud on the housetop. I ceased to be lord over,OW

15516,"myself. I was no longer the captain of my soul, and did not know it. I allowed",OW

15517,pleasure to dominate me. I ended in horrible disgrace. There is only one thing,OW

15518,"for me now, absolute humility.",OW

15519,I have lain in prison for nearly two years. Out of my nature has come wild,OW

15520,despair; an abandonment to grief that was piteous even to look at; terrible and,OW

15521,impotent rage; bitterness and scorn; anguish that wept aloud; misery that could,OW

15522,find no voice; sorrow that was dumb. I have passed through every possible,OW

15523,mood of suffering. Better than Wordsworth himself I know what Wordsworth,OW

15524,meant when he said�,OW

15525,"�Suffering is permanent, obscure, and dark",OW

15526,And has the nature of infinity.�,OW

15527,But while there were times when I rejoiced in the idea that my sufferings were,OW

15528,"to be endless, I could not bear them to be without meaning. Now I find hidden",OW

15529,somewhere away in my nature something that tells me that nothing in the,OW

15530,"whole world is meaningless, and suffering least of all. That something hidden",OW

15531,"away in my nature, like a treasure in a field, is Humility.",OW

15532,"It is the last thing left in me, and the best: the ultimate discovery at which I",OW

15533,"have arrived, the starting-point for a fresh development. It has come to me",OW

15534,"right out of myself, so I know that it has come at the proper time. It could not",OW

15535,"have come before, nor later. Had any one told me of it, I would have rejected",OW

15536,"it. Had it been brought to me, I would have refused it. As I found it, I want to",OW

15537,"keep it. I must do so. It is the one thing that has in it the elements of life, of a",OW

15538,"new life, Vita Nuova for me. Of all things it is the strangest. One cannot",OW

15539,"acquire it, except by surrendering everything that one has. It is only when one",OW

15540,"has lost all things, that one knows that one possesses it.",OW

15541,"Now I have realised that it is in me, I see quite clearly what I ought to do; in",OW

15542,"fact, must do. And when I use such a phrase as that, I need not say that I am",OW

15543,not alluding to any external sanction or command. I admit none. I am far,OW

15544,more of an individualist than I ever was. Nothing seems to me of the smallest,OW

15545,value except what one gets out of oneself. My nature is seeking a fresh mode,OW

15546,of self-realisation. That is all I am concerned with. And the first thing that I,OW

15547,have got to do is to free myself from any possible bitterness of feeling against,OW

15548,the world.,OW

15549,"I am completely penniless, and absolutely homeless. Yet there are worse",OW

15550,things in the world than that. I am quite candid when I say that rather than go,OW

15551,"out from this prison with bitterness in my heart against the world, I would",OW

15552,gladly and readily beg my bread from door to door. If I got nothing from the,OW

15553,house of the rich I would get something at the house of the poor. Those who,OW

15554,have much are often greedy; those who have little always share. I would not a,OW

15555,"bit mind sleeping in the cool grass in summer, and when winter came on",OW

15556,"sheltering myself by the warm close-thatched rick, or under the penthouse of a",OW

15557,"great barn, provided I had love in my heart. The external things of life seem to",OW

15558,me now of no importance at all. You can see to,OW

15559,what,OW

15560,intensity,OW

15561,of,OW

15562,"individualism I have arrived�or am arriving rather, for the journey is long,",OW

15563,and �where I walk there are thorns.�,OW

15564,"Of course I know that to ask alms on the highway is not to be my lot, and that",OW

15565,if ever I lie in the cool grass at night-time it will be to write sonnets to the,OW

15566,"moon. When I go out of prison, R--- will be waiting for me on the other side",OW

15567,"of the big iron-studded gate, and he is the symbol, not merely of his own",OW

15568,"affection, but of the affection of many others besides. I believe I am to have",OW

15569,"enough to live on for about eighteen months at any rate, so that if I may not",OW

15570,"write beautiful books, I may at least read beautiful books; and what joy can be",OW

15571,"greater? After that, I hope to be able to recreate my creative faculty.",OW

15572,But were things different: had I not a friend left in the world; were there not a,OW

15573,single house open to me in pity; had I to accept the wallet and ragged cloak of,OW

15574,"sheer penury: as long as I am free from all resentment, hardness and scorn, I",OW

15575,would be able to face the life with much more calm and confidence than I,OW

15576,"would were my body in purple and fine linen, and the soul within me sick with",OW

15577,hate.,OW

15578,And I really shall have no difficulty. When you really want love you will find,OW

15579,it waiting for you.,OW

15580,I need not say that my task does not end there. It would be comparatively easy,OW

15581,"if it did. There is much more before me. I have hills far steeper to climb,",OW

15582,valleys much darker to pass through. And I have to get it all out of myself.,OW

15583,"Neither religion, morality, nor reason can help me at all.",OW

15584,Morality does not help me. I am a born antinomian. I am one of those who are,OW

15585,"made for exceptions, not for laws. But while I see that there is nothing wrong",OW

15586,"in what one does, I see that there is something wrong in what one becomes. It",OW

15587,is well to have learned that.,OW

15588,"Religion does not help me. The faith that others give to what is unseen, I give",OW

15589,"to what one can touch, and look at. My gods dwell in temples made with",OW

15590,hands; and within the circle of actual experience is my creed made perfect and,OW

15591,"complete: too complete, it may be, for like many or all of those who have",OW

15592,"placed their heaven in this earth, I have found in it not merely the beauty of",OW

15593,"heaven, but the horror of hell also. When I think about religion at all, I feel as",OW

15594,if I would like to found an order for those who cannot believe: the,OW

15595,"Confraternity of the Faithless, one might call it, where on an altar, on which no",OW

15596,"taper burned, a priest, in whose heart peace had no dwelling, might celebrate",OW

15597,with unblessed bread and a chalice empty of wine. Everything to be true must,OW

15598,become a religion. And agnosticism should have its ritual no less than faith.,OW

15599,"It has sown its martyrs, it should reap its saints, and praise God daily for",OW

15600,"having hidden Himself from man. But whether it be faith or agnosticism, it",OW

15601,must be nothing external to me. Its symbols must be of my own creating.,OW

15602,Only that is spiritual which makes its own form. If I may not find its secret,OW

15603,"within myself, I shall never find it: if I have not got it already, it will never",OW

15604,come to me.,OW

15605,Reason does not help me. It tells me that the laws under which I am convicted,OW

15606,"are wrong and unjust laws, and the system under which I have suffered a",OW

15607,"wrong and unjust system. But, somehow, I have got to make both of these",OW

15608,things just and right to me. And exactly as in Art one is only concerned with,OW

15609,"what a particular thing is at a particular moment to oneself, so it is also in the",OW

15610,ethical evolution of one�s character. I have got to make everything that has,OW

15611,"happened to me good for me. The plank bed, the loathsome food, the hard",OW

15612,"ropes shredded into oakum till one�s finger-tips grow dull with pain, the",OW

15613,"menial offices with which each day begins and finishes, the harsh orders that",OW

15614,"routine seems to necessitate, the dreadful dress that makes sorrow grotesque to",OW

15615,"look at, the silence, the solitude, the shame�each and all of these things I",OW

15616,have to transform into a spiritual experience. There is not a single degradation,OW

15617,of the body which I must not try and make into a spiritualising of the soul.,OW

15618,"I want to get to the point when I shall be able to say quite simply, and without",OW

15619,affectation that the two great turning-points in my life were when my father,OW

15620,"sent me to Oxford, and when society sent me to prison. I will not say that",OW

15621,prison is the best thing that could have happened to me: for that phrase would,OW

15622,"savour of too great bitterness towards myself. I would sooner say, or hear it",OW

15623,"said of me, that I was so typical a child of my age, that in my perversity, and",OW

15624,"for that perversity�s sake, I turned the good things of my life to evil, and the",OW

15625,evil things of my life to good.,OW

15626,"What is said, however, by myself or by others, matters little. The important",OW

15627,"thing, the thing that lies before me, the thing that I have to do, if the brief",OW

15628,"remainder of my days is not to be maimed, marred, and incomplete, is to",OW

15629,"absorb into my nature all that has been done to me, to make it part of me, to",OW

15630,"accept it without complaint, fear, or reluctance. The supreme vice is",OW

15631,shallowness. Whatever is realised is right.,OW

15632,When first I was put into prison some people advised me to try and forget who,OW

15633,I was. It was ruinous advice. It is only by realising what I am that I have,OW

15634,found comfort of any kind. Now I am advised by others to try on my release,OW

15635,to forget that I have ever been in a prison at all. I know that would be equally,OW

15636,fatal. It would mean that I would always be haunted by an intolerable sense of,OW

15637,"disgrace, and that those things that are meant for me as much as for anybody",OW

15638,"else�the beauty of the sun and moon, the pageant of the seasons, the music of",OW

15639,"daybreak and the silence of great nights, the rain falling through the leaves, or",OW

15640,the dew creeping over the grass and making it silver�would all be tainted for,OW

15641,"me, and lose their healing power, and their power of communicating joy. To",OW

15642,regret one�s own experiences is to arrest one�s own development. To deny,OW

15643,one�s own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of one�s own life. It is no,OW

15644,less than a denial of the soul.,OW

15645,"For just as the body absorbs things of all kinds, things common and unclean",OW

15646,"no less than those that the priest or a vision has cleansed, and converts them",OW

15647,"into swiftness or strength, into the play of beautiful muscles and the moulding",OW

15648,"of fair flesh, into the curves and colours of the hair, the lips, the eye; so the",OW

15649,"soul in its turn has its nutritive functions also, and can transform into noble",OW

15650,"moods of thought and passions of high import what in itself is base, cruel and",OW

15651,"degrading; nay, more, may find in these its most august modes of assertion,",OW

15652,and can often reveal itself most perfectly through what was intended to,OW

15653,desecrate or destroy.,OW

15654,The fact of my having been the common prisoner of a common gaol I must,OW

15655,"frankly accept, and, curious as it may seem, one of the things I shall have to",OW

15656,"teach myself is not to be ashamed of it. I must accept it as a punishment, and",OW

15657,"if one is ashamed of having been punished, one might just as well never have",OW

15658,been punished at all. Of course there are many things of which I was,OW

15659,"convicted that I had not done, but then there are many things of which I was",OW

15660,"convicted that I had done, and a still greater number of things in my life for",OW

15661,"which I was never indicted at all. And as the gods are strange, and punish us",OW

15662,"for what is good and humane in us as much as for what is evil and perverse, I",OW

15663,must accept the fact that one is punished for the good as well as for the evil,OW

15664,"that one does. I have no doubt that it is quite right one should be. It helps one,",OW

15665,"or should help one, to realise both, and not to be too conceited about either.",OW

15666,"And if I then am not ashamed of my punishment, as I hope not to be, I shall be",OW

15667,"able to think, and walk, and live with freedom.",OW

15668,"Many men on their release carry their prison about with them into the air, and",OW

15669,"hide it as a secret disgrace in their hearts, and at length, like poor poisoned",OW

15670,"things, creep into some hole and die. It is wretched that they should have to",OW

15671,"do so, and it is wrong, terribly wrong, of society that it should force them to do",OW

15672,so. Society takes upon itself the right to inflict appalling punishment on the,OW

15673,"individual, but it also has the supreme vice of shallowness, and fails to realise",OW

15674,"what it has done. When the man�s punishment is over, it leaves him to",OW

15675,"himself; that is to say, it abandons him at the very moment when its highest",OW

15676,"duty towards him begins. It is really ashamed of its own actions, and shuns",OW

15677,"those whom it has punished, as people shun a creditor whose debt they cannot",OW

15678,"pay, or one on whom they have inflicted an irreparable, an irremediable",OW

15679,"wrong. I can claim on my side that if I realise what I have suffered, society",OW

15680,should realise what it has inflicted on me; and that there should be no,OW

15681,bitterness or hate on either side.,OW

15682,Of course I know that from one point of view things will be made different for,OW

15683,"me than for others; must indeed, by the very nature of the case, be made so.",OW

15684,The poor thieves and outcasts who are imprisoned here with me are in many,OW

15685,respects more fortunate than I am. The little way in grey city or green field,OW

15686,that saw their sin is small; to find those who know nothing of what they have,OW

15687,done they need go no further than a bird might fly between the twilight and the,OW

15688,"dawn; but for me the world is shrivelled to a handsbreadth, and everywhere I",OW

15689,"turn my name is written on the rocks in lead. For I have come, not from",OW

15690,"obscurity into the momentary notoriety of crime, but from a sort of eternity of",OW

15691,"fame to a sort of eternity of infamy, and sometimes seem to myself to have",OW

15692,"shown, if indeed it required showing, that between the famous and the",OW

15693,"infamous there is but one step, if as much as one.",OW

15694,"Still, in the very fact that people will recognise me wherever I go, and know",OW

15695,"all about my life, as far as its follies go, I can discern something good for me.",OW

15696,"It will force on me the necessity of again asserting myself as an artist, and as",OW

15697,soon as I possibly can. If I can produce only one beautiful work of art I shall,OW

15698,"be able to rob malice of its venom, and cowardice of its sneer, and to pluck out",OW

15699,the tongue of scorn by the roots.,OW

15700,"And if life be, as it surely is, a problem to me, I am no less a problem to life.",OW

15701,"People must adopt some attitude towards me, and so pass judgment, both on",OW

15702,themselves and me. I need not say I am not talking of particular individuals.,OW

15703,The only people I would care to be with now are artists and people who have,OW

15704,"suffered: those who know what beauty is, and those who know what sorrow is:",OW

15705,nobody else interests me. Nor am I making any demands on life. In all that I,OW

15706,have said I am simply concerned with my own mental attitude towards life as,OW

15707,a whole; and I feel that not to be ashamed of having been punished is one of,OW

15708,"the first points I must attain to, for the sake of my own perfection, and because",OW

15709,I am so imperfect.,OW

15710,"Then I must learn how to be happy. Once I knew it, or thought I knew it, by",OW

15711,instinct. It was always springtime once in my heart. My temperament was,OW

15712,"akin to joy. I filled my life to the very brim with pleasure, as one might fill a",OW

15713,cup to the very brim with wine. Now I am approaching life from a completely,OW

15714,"new standpoint, and even to conceive happiness is often extremely difficult for",OW

15715,me. I remember during my first term at Oxford reading in Pater�s Renaissance,OW

15716,�that book which has had such strange influence over my life�how Dante,OW

15717,places low in the Inferno those who wilfully live in sadness; and going to the,OW

15718,college library and turning to the passage in the Divine Comedy where,OW

15719,"beneath the dreary marsh lie those who were �sullen in the sweet air,� saying",OW

15720,for ever and ever through their sighs�,OW

15721,�Tristi fummo,OW

15722,Nell aer dolce che dal sol s�allegra.�,OW

15723,"I knew the church condemned accidia, but the whole idea seemed to me quite",OW

15724,"fantastic, just the sort of sin, I fancied, a priest who knew nothing about real",OW

15725,"life would invent. Nor could I understand how Dante, who says that �sorrow",OW

15726,"remarries us to God,� could have been so harsh to those who were enamoured",OW

15727,"of melancholy, if any such there really were. I had no idea that someday this",OW

15728,would become to me one of the greatest temptations of my life.,OW

15729,While I was in Wandsworth prison I longed to die. It was my one desire.,OW

15730,"When after two months in the infirmary I was transferred here, and found",OW

15731,"myself growing gradually better in physical health, I was filled with rage. I",OW

15732,determined to commit suicide on the very day on which I left prison. After a,OW

15733,"time that evil mood passed away, and I made up my mind to live, but to wear",OW

15734,gloom as a king wears purple: never to smile again: to turn whatever house I,OW

15735,entered into a house of mourning: to make my friends walk slowly in sadness,OW

15736,with me: to teach them that melancholy is the true secret of life: to maim them,OW

15737,with an alien sorrow: to mar them with my own pain. Now I feel quite,OW

15738,differently. I see it would be both ungrateful and unkind of me to pull so long,OW

15739,a face that when my friends came to see me they would have to make their,OW

15740,"faces still longer in order to show their sympathy; or, if I desired to entertain",OW

15741,"them, to invite them to sit down silently to bitter herbs and funeral baked",OW

15742,meats. I must learn how to be cheerful and happy.,OW

15743,"The last two occasions on which I was allowed to see my friends here, I tried",OW

15744,"to be as cheerful as possible, and to show my cheerfulness, in order to make",OW

15745,them some slight return for their trouble in coming all the way from town to,OW

15746,"see me. It is only a slight return, I know, but it is the one, I feel certain, that",OW

15747,"pleases them most. I saw R--- for an hour on Saturday week, and I tried to",OW

15748,give the fullest possible expression of the delight I really felt at our meeting.,OW

15749,"And that, in the views and ideas I am here shaping for myself, I am quite right",OW

15750,is shown to me by the fact that now for the first time since my imprisonment I,OW

15751,have a real desire for life.,OW

15752,"There is before me so much to do, that I would regard it as a terrible tragedy if",OW

15753,I died before I was allowed to complete at any rate a little of it. I see new,OW

15754,"developments in art and life, each one of which is a fresh mode of perfection. I",OW

15755,long to live so that I can explore what is no less than a new world to me. Do,OW

15756,you want to know what this new world is? I think you can guess what it is. It,OW

15757,"is the world in which I have been living. Sorrow, then, and all that it teaches",OW

15758,"one, is my new world.",OW

15759,I used to live entirely for pleasure. I shunned suffering and sorrow of every,OW

15760,"kind. I hated both. I resolved to ignore them as far as possible: to treat them,",OW

15761,"that is to say, as modes of imperfection. They were not part of my scheme of",OW

15762,"life. They had no place in my philosophy. My mother, who knew life as a",OW

15763,"whole, used often to quote to me Goethe�s lines�written by Carlyle in a book",OW

15764,"he had given her years ago, and translated by him, I fancy, also:�",OW

15765,"�Who never ate his bread in sorrow,",OW

15766,Who never spent the midnight hours,OW

15767,"Weeping and waiting for the morrow,�",OW

15768,"He knows you not, ye heavenly powers.�",OW

15769,"They were the lines which that noble Queen of Prussia, whom Napoleon",OW

15770,"treated with such coarse brutality, used to quote in her humiliation and exile;",OW

15771,they were the lines my mother often quoted in the troubles of her later life. I,OW

15772,absolutely declined to accept or admit the enormous truth hidden in them. I,OW

15773,could not understand it. I remember quite well how I used to tell her that I did,OW

15774,"not want to eat my bread in sorrow, or to pass any night weeping and watching",OW

15775,for a more bitter dawn.,OW

15776,I had no idea that it was one of the special things that the Fates had in store for,OW

15777,"me: that for a whole year of my life, indeed, I was to do little else. But so has",OW

15778,"my portion been meted out to me; and during the last few months I have, after",OW

15779,"terrible difficulties and struggles, been able to comprehend some of the lessons",OW

15780,hidden in the heart of pain. Clergymen and people who use phrases without,OW

15781,wisdom sometimes talk of suffering as a mystery. It is really a revelation.,OW

15782,One discerns things one never discerned before. One approaches the whole of,OW

15783,"history from a different standpoint. What one had felt dimly, through instinct,",OW

15784,"about art, is intellectually and emotionally realised with perfect clearness of",OW

15785,vision and absolute intensity of apprehension.,OW

15786,"I now see that sorrow, being the supreme emotion of which man is capable, is",OW

15787,at once the type and test of all great art. What the artist is always looking for,OW

15788,is the mode of existence in which soul and body are one and indivisible: in,OW

15789,which the outward is expressive of the inward: in which form reveals. Of such,OW

15790,modes of existence there are not a few: youth and the arts preoccupied with,OW

15791,youth may serve as a model for us at one moment: at another we may like to,OW

15792,"think that, in its subtlety and sensitiveness of impression, its suggestion of a",OW

15793,"spirit dwelling in external things and making its raiment of earth and air, of",OW

15794,"mist and city alike, and in its morbid sympathy of its moods, and tones, and",OW

15795,"colours, modern landscape art is realising for us pictorially what was realised",OW

15796,"in such plastic perfection by the Greeks. Music, in which all subject is",OW

15797,"absorbed in expression and cannot be separated from it, is a complex example,",OW

15798,"and a flower or a child a simple example, of what I mean; but sorrow is the",OW

15799,ultimate type both in life and art.,OW

15800,"Behind joy and laughter there may be a temperament, coarse, hard and callous.",OW

15801,"But behind sorrow there is always sorrow. Pain, unlike pleasure, wears no",OW

15802,mask. Truth in art is not any correspondence between the essential idea and,OW

15803,"the accidental existence; it is not the resemblance of shape to shadow, or of the",OW

15804,form mirrored in the crystal to the form itself; it is no echo coming from a,OW

15805,"hollow hill, any more than it is a silver well of water in the valley that shows",OW

15806,the moon to the moon and Narcissus to Narcissus. Truth in art is the unity of a,OW

15807,thing with itself: the outward rendered expressive of the inward: the soul made,OW

15808,incarnate: the body instinct with spirit. For this reason there is no truth,OW

15809,comparable to sorrow. There are times when sorrow seems to me to be the,OW

15810,"only truth. Other things may be illusions of the eye or the appetite, made to",OW

15811,"blind the one and cloy the other, but out of sorrow have the worlds been built,",OW

15812,and at the birth of a child or a star there is pain.,OW

15813,"More than this, there is about sorrow an intense, an extraordinary reality. I",OW

15814,have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art,OW

15815,and culture of my age. There is not a single wretched man in this wretched,OW

15816,place along with me who does not stand in symbolic relation to the very secret,OW

15817,of life. For the secret of life is suffering. It is what is hidden behind,OW

15818,"everything. When we begin to live, what is sweet is so sweet to us, and what is",OW

15819,"bitter so bitter, that we inevitably direct all our desires towards pleasures, and",OW

15820,"seek not merely for a �month or twain to feed on honeycomb,� but for all our",OW

15821,"years to taste no other food, ignorant all the while that we may really be",OW

15822,starving the soul.,OW

15823,I remember talking once on this subject to one of the most beautiful,OW

15824,"personalities I have ever known: a woman, whose sympathy and noble",OW

15825,"kindness to me, both before and since the tragedy of my imprisonment, have",OW

15826,"been beyond power and description; one who has really assisted me, though",OW

15827,"she does not know it, to bear the burden of my troubles more than anyone else",OW

15828,"in the whole world has, and all through the mere fact of her existence, through",OW

15829,her being what she is�partly an ideal and partly an influence: a suggestion of,OW

15830,what one might become as well as a real help towards becoming it; a soul that,OW

15831,"renders the common air sweet, and makes what is spiritual seem as simple and",OW

15832,natural as sunlight or the sea: one for whom beauty and sorrow walk hand in,OW

15833,"hand, and have the same message. On the occasion of which I am thinking I",OW

15834,recall distinctly how I said to her that there was enough suffering in one,OW

15835,"narrow London lane to show that God did not love man, and that wherever",OW

15836,"there was any sorrow, though but that of a child, in some little garden weeping",OW

15837,"over a fault that it had or had not committed, the whole face of creation was",OW

15838,"completely marred. I was entirely wrong. She told me so, but I could not",OW

15839,believe her. I was not in the sphere in which such belief was to be attained to.,OW

15840,Now it seems to me that love of some kind is the only possible explanation of,OW

15841,the extraordinary amount of suffering that there is in the world. I cannot,OW

15842,"conceive of any other explanation. I am convinced that there is no other, and",OW

15843,"that if the world has indeed, as I have said, been built of sorrow, it has been",OW

15844,"built by the hands of love, because in no other way could the soul of man, for",OW

15845,"whom the world was made, reach the full stature of its perfection. Pleasure for",OW

15846,"the beautiful body, but pain for the beautiful soul.",OW

15847,When I say that I am convinced of these things I speak with too much pride.,OW

15848,"Far off, like a perfect pearl, one can see the city of God. It is so wonderful that",OW

15849,it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer�s day. And so a child could.,OW

15850,But with me and such as me it is different. One can realise a thing in a single,OW

15851,"moment, but one loses it in the long hours that follow with leaden feet. It is so",OW

15852,difficult to keep �heights that the soul is competent to gain.� We think in,OW

15853,"eternity, but we move slowly through time; and how slowly time goes with us",OW

15854,"who lie in prison I need not tell again, nor of the weariness and despair that",OW

15855,"creep back into one�s cell, and into the cell of one�s heart, with such strange",OW

15856,"insistence that one has, as it were, to garnish and sweep one�s house for their",OW

15857,"coming, as for an unwelcome guest, or a bitter master, or a slave whose slave",OW

15858,it is one�s chance or choice to be.,OW

15859,"And, though at present my friends may find it a hard thing to believe, it is true",OW

15860,"none the less, that for them living in freedom and idleness and comfort it is",OW

15861,"more easy to learn the lessons of humility than it is for me, who begin the day",OW

15862,by going down on my knees and washing the floor of my cell. For prison life,OW

15863,with its endless privations and restrictions makes one rebellious. The most,OW

15864,terrible thing about it is not that it breaks one�s heart�hearts are made to be,OW

15865,broken�but that it turns one�s heart to stone. One sometimes feels that it is,OW

15866,only with a front of brass and a lip of scorn that one can get through the day at,OW

15867,"all. And he who is in a state of rebellion cannot receive grace, to use the",OW

15868,"phrase of which the Church is so fond�so rightly fond, I dare say�for in life",OW

15869,"as in art the mood of rebellion closes up the channels of the soul, and shuts out",OW

15870,"the airs of heaven. Yet I must learn these lessons here, if I am to learn them",OW

15871,"anywhere, and must be filled with joy if my feet are on the right road and my",OW

15872,"face set towards �the gate which is called beautiful,� though I may fall many",OW

15873,times in the mire and often in the mist go astray.,OW

15874,"This New Life, as through my love of Dante I like sometimes to call it, is of",OW

15875,"course no new life at all, but simply the continuance, by means of",OW

15876,"development, and evolution, of my former life. I remember when I was at",OW

15877,Oxford saying to one of my friends as we were strolling round Magdalen�s,OW

15878,"narrow bird-haunted walks one morning in the year before I took my degree,",OW

15879,"that I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world, and",OW

15880,"that I was going out into the world with that passion in my soul. And so,",OW

15881,"indeed, I went out, and so I lived. My only mistake was that I confined myself",OW

15882,"so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sun-lit side of the garden,",OW

15883,"and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom. Failure, disgrace,",OW

15884,"poverty, sorrow, despair, suffering, tears even, the broken words that come",OW

15885,"from lips in pain, remorse that makes one walk on thorns, conscience that",OW

15886,"condemns, self-abasement that punishes, the misery that puts ashes on its",OW

15887,"head, the anguish that chooses sack-cloth for its raiment and into its own drink",OW

15888,puts gall:�all these were things of which I was afraid. And as I had,OW

15889,"determined to know nothing of them, I was forced to taste each of them in",OW

15890,"turn, to feed on them, to have for a season, indeed, no other food at all.",OW

15891,"I don�t regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure. I did it to the full,",OW

15892,as one should do everything that one does. There was no pleasure I did not,OW

15893,experience. I threw the pearl of my soul into a cup of wine. I went down the,OW

15894,primrose path to the sound of flutes. I lived on honeycomb. But to have,OW

15895,continued the same life would have been wrong because it would have been,OW

15896,limiting. I had to pass on. The other half of the garden had its secrets for me,OW

15897,also. Of course all this is foreshadowed and prefigured in my books. Some of,OW

15898,"it is in The Happy Prince, some of it in The Young King, notably in the",OW

15899,"passage where the bishop says to the kneeling boy, �Is not He who made",OW

15900,misery wiser than thou art�? a phrase which when I wrote it seemed to me,OW

15901,little more than a phrase; a great deal of it is hidden away in the note of doom,OW

15902,that like a purple thread runs through the texture of Dorian Gray; in The Critic,OW

15903,"as Artist it is set forth in many colours; in The Soul of Man it is written down,",OW

15904,and in letters too easy to read; it is one of the refrains whose recurring motifs,OW

15905,make Salome so like a piece of music and bind it together as a ballad; in the,OW

15906,prose poem of the man who from the bronze of the image of the �Pleasure that,OW

15907,liveth for a moment� has to make the image of the �Sorrow that abideth for,OW

15908,ever� it is incarnate. It could not have been otherwise. At every single,OW

15909,moment of one�s life one is what one is going to be no less than what one has,OW

15910,"been. Art is a symbol, because man is a symbol.",OW

15911,"It is, if I can fully attain to it, the ultimate realisation of the artistic life. For",OW

15912,the artistic life is simply self-development. Humility in the artist is his frank,OW

15913,"acceptance of all experiences, just as love in the artist is simply the sense of",OW

15914,beauty that reveals to the world its body and its soul. In Marius the Epicurean,OW

15915,"Pater seeks to reconcile the artistic life with the life of religion, in the deep,",OW

15916,"sweet, and austere sense of the word. But Marius is little more than a",OW

15917,"spectator: an ideal spectator indeed, and one to whom it is given �to",OW

15918,"contemplate the spectacle of life with appropriate emotions,� which",OW

15919,"Wordsworth defines as the poet�s true aim; yet a spectator merely, and perhaps",OW

15920,a little too much occupied with the comeliness of the benches of the sanctuary,OW

15921,to notice that it is the sanctuary of sorrow that he is gazing at.,OW

15922,I see a far more intimate and immediate connection between the true life of,OW

15923,Christ and the true life of the artist; and I take a keen pleasure in the reflection,OW

15924,that long before sorrow had made my days her own and bound me to her,OW

15925,wheel I had written in The Soul of Man that he who would lead a Christ-like,OW

15926,"life must be entirely and absolutely himself, and had taken as my types not",OW

15927,"merely the shepherd on the hillside and the prisoner in his cell, but also the",OW

15928,painter to whom the world is a pageant and the poet for whom the world is a,OW

15929,"song. I remember saying once to Andr� Gide, as we sat together in some Paris",OW

15930,"caf�, that while meta-physics had but little real interest for me, and morality",OW

15931,"absolutely none, there was nothing that either Plato or Christ had said that",OW

15932,could not be transferred immediately into the sphere of Art and there find its,OW

15933,complete fulfilment.,OW

15934,Nor is it merely that we can discern in Christ that close union of personality,OW

15935,with perfection which forms the real distinction between the classical and,OW

15936,"romantic movement in life, but the very basis of his nature was the same as",OW

15937,that of the nature of the artist�an intense and flamelike imagination. He,OW

15938,realised in the entire sphere of human relations that imaginative sympathy,OW

15939,which in the sphere of Art is the sole secret of creation. He understood the,OW

15940,"leprosy of the leper, the darkness of the blind, the fierce misery of those who",OW

15941,"live for pleasure, the strange poverty of the rich. Some one wrote to me in",OW

15942,"trouble, �When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting.� How",OW

15943,remote was the writer from what Matthew Arnold calls �the Secret of Jesus.�,OW

15944,Either would have taught him that whatever happens to another happens to,OW

15945,"oneself, and if you want an inscription to read at dawn and at night-time, and",OW

15946,"for pleasure or for pain, write up on the walls of your house in letters for the",OW

15947,"sun to gild and the moon to silver, �Whatever happens to oneself happens to",OW

15948,another.�,OW

15949,Christ�s place indeed is with the poets. His whole conception of Humanity,OW

15950,sprang right out of the imagination and can only be realised by it. What God,OW

15951,"was to the pantheist, man was to Him. He was the first to conceive the divided",OW

15952,"races as a unity. Before his time there had been gods and men, and, feeling",OW

15953,through the mysticism of sympathy that in himself each had been made,OW

15954,"incarnate, he calls himself the Son of the one or the Son of the other, according",OW

15955,to his mood. More than any one else in history he wakes in us that temper of,OW

15956,wonder to which romance always appeals. There is still something to me,OW

15957,almost incredible in the idea of a young Galilean peasant imagining that he,OW

15958,could bear on his own shoulders the burden of the entire world; all that had,OW

15959,"already been done and suffered, and all that was yet to be done and suffered:",OW

15960,"the sins of Nero, of Caesar Borgia, of Alexander VI., and of him who was",OW

15961,Emperor of Rome and Priest of the Sun: the sufferings of those whose names,OW

15962,"are legion and whose dwelling is among the tombs: oppressed nationalities,",OW

15963,"factory children, thieves, people in prison, outcasts, those who are dumb under",OW

15964,oppression and whose silence is heard only of God; and not merely imagining,OW

15965,"this but actually achieving it, so that at the present moment all who come in",OW

15966,"contact with his personality, even though they may neither bow to his altar nor",OW

15967,"kneel before his priest, in some way find that the ugliness of their sin is taken",OW

15968,away and the beauty of their sorrow revealed to them.,OW

15969,I had said of Christ that he ranks with the poets. That is true. Shelley and,OW

15970,Sophocles are of his company. But his entire life also is the most wonderful of,OW

15971,poems. For �pity and terror� there is nothing in the entire cycle of Greek,OW

15972,tragedy to touch it. The absolute purity of the protagonist raises the entire,OW

15973,scheme to a height of romantic art from which the sufferings of Thebes and,OW

15974,"Pelops� line are by their very horror excluded, and shows how wrong Aristotle",OW

15975,was when he said in his treatise on the drama that it would be impossible to,OW

15976,"bear the spectacle of one blameless in pain. Nor in �schylus nor Dante, those",OW

15977,"stern masters of tenderness, in Shakespeare, the most purely human of all the",OW

15978,"great artists, in the whole of Celtic myth and legend, where the loveliness of",OW

15979,"the world is shown through a mist of tears, and the life of a man is no more",OW

15980,"than the life of a flower, is there anything that, for sheer simplicity of pathos",OW

15981,"wedded and made one with sublimity of tragic effect, can be said to equal or",OW

15982,even approach the last act of Christ�s passion. The little supper with his,OW

15983,"companions, one of whom has already sold him for a price; the anguish in the",OW

15984,quiet moon-lit garden; the false friend coming close to him so as to betray him,OW

15985,"with a kiss; the friend who still believed in him, and on whom as on a rock he",OW

15986,"had hoped to build a house of refuge for Man, denying him as the bird cried to",OW

15987,"the dawn; his own utter loneliness, his submission, his acceptance of",OW

15988,everything; and along with it all such scenes as the high priest of orthodoxy,OW

15989,"rending his raiment in wrath, and the magistrate of civil justice calling for",OW

15990,water in the vain hope of cleansing himself of that stain of innocent blood that,OW

15991,"makes him the scarlet figure of history; the coronation ceremony of sorrow,",OW

15992,one of the most wonderful things in the whole of recorded time; the,OW

15993,crucifixion of the Innocent One before the eyes of his mother and of the,OW

15994,disciple whom he loved; the soldiers gambling and throwing dice for his,OW

15995,clothes; the terrible death by which he gave the world its most eternal symbol;,OW

15996,"and his final burial in the tomb of the rich man, his body swathed in Egyptian",OW

15997,linen with costly spices and perfumes as though he had been a king�s son.,OW

15998,When one contemplates all this from the point of view of art alone one cannot,OW

15999,but be grateful that the supreme office of the Church should be the playing of,OW

16000,"the tragedy without the shedding of blood: the mystical presentation, by means",OW

16001,"of dialogue and costume and gesture even, of the Passion of her Lord; and it is",OW

16002,always a source of pleasure and awe to me to remember that the ultimate,OW

16003,"survival of the Greek chorus, lost elsewhere to art, is to be found in the",OW

16004,servitor answering the priest at Mass.,OW

16005,Yet the whole life of Christ�so entirely may sorrow and beauty be made one,OW

16006,"in their meaning and manifestation�is really an idyll, though it ends with the",OW

16007,"veil of the temple being rent, and the darkness coming over the face of the",OW

16008,"earth, and the stone rolled to the door of the sepulchre. One always thinks of",OW

16009,"him as a young bridegroom with his companions, as indeed he somewhere",OW

16010,describes himself; as a shepherd straying through a valley with his sheep in,OW

16011,search of green meadow or cool stream; as a singer trying to build out of the,OW

16012,music the walls of the City of God; or as a lover for whose love the whole,OW

16013,world was too small. His miracles seem to me to be as exquisite as the,OW

16014,"coming of spring, and quite as natural. I see no difficulty at all in believing",OW

16015,that such was the charm of his personality that his mere presence could bring,OW

16016,"peace to souls in anguish, and that those who touched his garments or his",OW

16017,hands forgot their pain; or that as he passed by on the highway of life people,OW

16018,"who had seen nothing of life�s mystery, saw it clearly, and others who had",OW

16019,been deaf to every voice but that of pleasure heard for the first time the voice,OW

16020,of love and found it as �musical as Apollo�s lute�; or that evil passions fled at,OW

16021,"his approach, and men whose dull unimaginative lives had been but a mode of",OW

16022,death rose as it were from the grave when he called them; or that when he,OW

16023,taught on the hillside the multitude forgot their hunger and thirst and the cares,OW

16024,"of this world, and that to his friends who listened to him as he sat at meat the",OW

16025,"coarse food seemed delicate, and the water had the taste of good wine, and the",OW

16026,whole house became full of the odour and sweetness of nard.,OW

16027,"Renan in his Vie de Jesus�that gracious fifth gospel, the gospel according to",OW

16028,"St. Thomas, one might call it�says somewhere that Christ�s great",OW

16029,achievement was that he made himself as much loved after his death as he had,OW

16030,"been during his lifetime. And certainly, if his place is among the poets, he is",OW

16031,the leader of all the lovers. He saw that love was the first secret of the world,OW

16032,"for which the wise men had been looking, and that it was only through",OW

16033,love,OW

16034,that one could approach either the heart of the leper or the feet of God.,OW

16035,"And above all, Christ is the most supreme of individualists. Humility, like the",OW

16036,"artistic, acceptance of all experiences, is merely a mode of manifestation. It is",OW

16037,"man�s soul that Christ is always looking for. He calls it �God�s Kingdom,� and",OW

16038,"finds it in every one. He compares it to little things, to a tiny seed, to a",OW

16039,"handful of leaven, to a pearl. That is because one realises one�s soul only by",OW

16040,"getting rid of all alien passions, all acquired culture, and all external",OW

16041,"possessions, be they good or evil.",OW

16042,I bore up against everything with some stubbornness of will and much,OW

16043,"rebellion of nature, till I had absolutely nothing left in the world but one thing.",OW

16044,"I had lost my name, my position, my happiness, my freedom, my wealth. I was",OW

16045,a prisoner and a pauper. But I still had my children left. Suddenly they were,OW

16046,taken away from me by the law. It was a blow so appalling that I did not know,OW

16047,"what to do, so I flung myself on my knees, and bowed my head, and wept, and",OW

16048,"said, �The body of a child is as the body of the Lord: I am not worthy of",OW

16049,either.� That moment seemed to save me. I saw then that the only thing for me,OW

16050,was to accept everything. Since then�curious as it will no doubt sound�I,OW

16051,have been happier. It was of course my soul in its ultimate essence that I had,OW

16052,"reached. In many ways I had been its enemy, but I found it waiting for me as a",OW

16053,friend. When one comes in contact with the soul it makes one simple as a,OW

16054,"child, as Christ said one should be.",OW

16055,It is tragic how few people ever �possess their souls� before they die. �Nothing,OW

16056,"is more rare in any man,� says Emerson, �than an act of his own.� It is quite",OW

16057,true. Most people are other people. Their thoughts are some,OW

16058,one else�s,OW

16059,"opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation. Christ was not",OW

16060,"merely the supreme individualist, but he was the first individualist in history.",OW

16061,"People have tried to make him out an ordinary philanthropist, or ranked him as",OW

16062,an altruist with the scientific and sentimental. But he was really neither one,OW

16063,"nor the other. Pity he has, of course, for the poor, for those who are shut up in",OW

16064,"prisons, for the lowly, for the wretched; but he has far more pity for the rich,",OW

16065,"for the hard hedonists, for those who waste their freedom in becoming slaves",OW

16066,"to things, for those who wear soft raiment and live in kings� houses. Riches",OW

16067,and pleasure seemed to him to be really greater tragedies than poverty or,OW

16068,"sorrow. And as for altruism, who knew better than he that it is vocation not",OW

16069,"volition that determines us, and that one cannot gather grapes of thorns or figs",OW

16070,from thistles?,OW

16071,To live for others as a definite self-conscious aim was not his creed. It was not,OW

16072,"the basis of his creed. When he says, �Forgive your enemies,� it is not for the",OW

16073,"sake of the enemy, but for one�s own sake that he says so, and because love is",OW

16074,"more beautiful than hate. In his own entreaty to the young man, �Sell all that",OW

16075,"thou hast and give to the poor,� it is not of the state of the poor that he is",OW

16076,"thinking but of the soul of the young man, the soul that wealth was marring. In",OW

16077,his view of life he is one with the artist who knows that by the inevitable law,OW

16078,"of self-perfection, the poet must sing, and the sculptor think in bronze, and the",OW

16079,"painter make the world a mirror for his moods, as surely and as certainly as the",OW

16080,"hawthorn must blossom in spring, and the corn turn to gold at harvest-time,",OW

16081,"and the moon in her ordered wanderings change from shield to sickle, and",OW

16082,from sickle to shield.,OW

16083,"But while Christ did not say to men, �Live for others,� he pointed out that there",OW

16084,was no difference at all between the lives of others and one�s own life. By this,OW

16085,"means he gave to man an extended, a Titan personality. Since his coming the",OW

16086,"history of each separate individual is, or can be made, the history of the world.",OW

16087,"Of course, culture has intensified the personality of man. Art has made us",OW

16088,myriad-minded. Those who have the artistic temperament go into exile with,OW

16089,"Dante and learn how salt is the bread of others, and how steep their stairs; they",OW

16090,"catch for a moment the serenity and calm of Goethe, and yet know but too",OW

16091,well that Baudelaire cried to God�,OW

16092,"�O Seigneur, donnez moi la force et le courage",OW

16093,De contempler mon corps et mon coeur sans d�go�t.�,OW

16094,"Out of Shakespeare�s sonnets they draw, to their own hurt it may be, the secret",OW

16095,"of his love and make it their own; they look with new eyes on modern life,",OW

16096,"because they have listened to one of Chopin�s nocturnes, or handled Greek",OW

16097,"things, or read the story of the passion of some dead man for some dead",OW

16098,"woman whose hair was like threads of fine gold, and whose mouth was as a",OW

16099,pomegranate. But the sympathy of the artistic temperament is necessarily with,OW

16100,"what has found expression. In words or in colours, in music or in marble,",OW

16101,"behind the painted masks of an �schylean play, or through some Sicilian",OW

16102,"shepherds� pierced and jointed reeds, the man and his message must have been",OW

16103,revealed.,OW

16104,"To the artist, expression is the only mode under which he can conceive life at",OW

16105,all. To him what is dumb is dead. But to Christ it was not so. With a width,OW

16106,"and wonder of imagination that fills one almost with awe, he took the entire",OW

16107,"world of the inarticulate, the voiceless world of pain, as his kingdom, and",OW

16108,"made of himself its eternal mouthpiece. Those of whom I have spoken, who",OW

16109,"are dumb under oppression, and �whose silence is heard only of God,� he",OW

16110,"chose as his brothers. He sought to become eyes to the blind, ears to the deaf,",OW

16111,and a cry in the lips of those whose tongues had been tied. His desire was to,OW

16112,be to the myriads who had found no utterance a very trumpet through which,OW

16113,"they might call to heaven. And feeling, with the artistic nature of one to",OW

16114,whom suffering and sorrow were modes through which he could realise,OW

16115,his,OW

16116,"conception of the beautiful, that an idea is of no value till it becomes incarnate",OW

16117,"and is made an image, he made of himself the image of the Man of Sorrows,",OW

16118,and as such has fascinated and dominated art as no Greek god ever succeeded,OW

16119,in doing.,OW

16120,"For the Greek gods, in spite of the white and red of their fair fleet limbs, were",OW

16121,not really what they appeared to be. The curved brow of Apollo was like the,OW

16122,"sun�s disc crescent over a hill at dawn, and his feet were as the wings of the",OW

16123,"morning, but he himself had been cruel to Marsyas and had made Niobe",OW

16124,childless. In the steel shields of Athena�s eyes there had been no pity for,OW

16125,Arachne; the pomp and peacocks of Hera were all that was really noble about,OW

16126,her; and the Father of the Gods himself had been too fond of the daughters of,OW

16127,"men. The two most deeply suggestive figures of Greek Mythology were, for",OW

16128,"religion, Demeter, an Earth Goddess, not one of the Olympians, and for art,",OW

16129,"Dionysus, the son of a mortal woman to whom the moment of his birth had",OW

16130,proved also the moment of her death.,OW

16131,But Life itself from its lowliest and most humble sphere produced one far,OW

16132,more marvellous than the mother of Proserpina or the son of Semele. Out of,OW

16133,the Carpenter�s shop at Nazareth had come a personality infinitely greater than,OW

16134,"any made by myth and legend, and one, strangely enough, destined to reveal to",OW

16135,the world the mystical meaning of wine and the real beauties of the lilies of,OW

16136,"the field as none, either on Cithaeron or at Enna, had ever done.",OW

16137,"The song of Isaiah, �He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and",OW

16138,"acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him,� had seemed",OW

16139,"to him to prefigure himself, and in him the prophecy was fulfilled. We must",OW

16140,not be afraid of such a phrase. Every single work of art is the fulfilment of a,OW

16141,prophecy: for every work of art is the conversion of an idea into an image.,OW

16142,Every single human being should be the fulfilment of a prophecy: for every,OW

16143,"human being should be the realisation of some ideal, either in the mind of God",OW

16144,"or in the mind of man. Christ found the type and fixed it, and the dream of a",OW

16145,"Virgilian poet, either at Jerusalem or at Babylon, became in the long progress",OW

16146,of the centuries incarnate in him for whom the world was waiting.,OW

16147,To me one of the things in history the most to be regretted is that the Christ�s,OW

16148,"own renaissance, which has produced the Cathedral at Chartres, the Arthurian",OW

16149,"cycle of legends, the life of St. Francis of Assisi, the art of Giotto, and Dante�s",OW

16150,"Divine Comedy, was not allowed to develop on its own lines, but was",OW

16151,interrupted and spoiled by the dreary classical Renaissance that gave us,OW

16152,"Petrarch, and Raphael�s frescoes, and Palladian architecture, and formal",OW

16153,"French tragedy, and St. Paul�s Cathedral, and Pope�s poetry, and everything",OW

16154,"that is made from without and by dead rules, and does not spring from within",OW

16155,through some spirit informing it. But wherever there is a romantic movement,OW

16156,"in art there somehow, and under some form, is Christ, or the soul of Christ.",OW

16157,"He is in Romeo and Juliet, in the Winter�s Tale, in Proven�al poetry, in the",OW

16158,"Ancient Mariner, in La Belle Dame sans merci, and in Chatterton�s Ballad of",OW

16159,Charity.,OW

16160,"We owe to him the most diverse things and people. Hugo�s Les Mis�rables,",OW

16161,"Baudelaire�s Fleurs du Mal, the note of pity in Russian novels, Verlaine and",OW

16162,"Verlaine�s poems, the stained glass and tapestries and the quattro-cento work",OW

16163,"of Burne-Jones and Morris, belong to him no less than the tower of Giotto,",OW

16164,"Lancelot and Guinevere, Tannh�user, the troubled romantic marbles of",OW

16165,"Michael Angelo, pointed architecture, and the love of children and flowers�",OW

16166,"for both of which, indeed, in classical art there was but little place, hardly",OW

16167,"enough for them to grow or play in, but which, from the twelfth century down",OW

16168,"to our own day, have been continually making their appearances in art, under",OW

16169,"various modes and at various times, coming fitfully and wilfully, as children,",OW

16170,"as flowers, are apt to do: spring always seeming to one as if the flowers had",OW

16171,"been in hiding, and only came out into the sun because they were afraid that",OW

16172,grown up people would grow tired of looking for them and give up the search;,OW

16173,and the life of a child being no more than an April day on which there is both,OW

16174,rain and sun for the narcissus.,OW

16175,It is the imaginative quality of Christ�s own nature that makes him this,OW

16176,palpitating centre of romance. The strange figures of poetic drama and ballad,OW

16177,"are made by the imagination of others, but out of his own imagination entirely",OW

16178,did Jesus of Nazareth create himself. The cry of Isaiah had really no more to,OW

16179,do with his coming than the song of the nightingale has to do with the rising of,OW

16180,"the moon�no more, though perhaps no less. He was the denial as well as the",OW

16181,affirmation of prophecy. For every expectation that he fulfilled there was,OW

16182,"another that he destroyed. �In all beauty,� says Bacon, �there is some",OW

16183,"strangeness of proportion,� and of those who are born of the spirit�of those,",OW

16184,"that is to say, who like himself are dynamic forces�Christ says that they are",OW

16185,"like the wind that �bloweth where it listeth, and no man can tell whence it",OW

16186,cometh and whither it goeth.� That is why he is so fascinating to artists. He,OW

16187,"has all the colour elements of life: mystery, strangeness, pathos, suggestion,",OW

16188,"ecstasy, love. He appeals to the temper of wonder, and creates that mood in",OW

16189,which alone he can be understood.,OW

16190,"And to me it is a joy to remember that if he is �of imagination all compact,� the",OW

16191,world itself is of the same substance. I said in Dorian Gray that the great sins,OW

16192,of the world take place in the brain: but it is in the brain that everything takes,OW

16193,place. We know now that we do not see with the eyes or hear with the ears.,OW

16194,"They are really channels for the transmission, adequate or inadequate, of sense",OW

16195,"impressions. It is in the brain that the poppy is red, that the apple is odorous,",OW

16196,that the skylark sings.,OW

16197,Of late I have been studying with diligence the four prose poems about Christ.,OW

16198,"At Christmas I managed to get hold of a Greek Testament, and every morning,",OW

16199,"after I had cleaned my cell and polished my tins, I read a little of the Gospels,",OW

16200,a dozen verses taken by chance anywhere. It is a delightful way of opening,OW

16201,"the day. Everyone, even in a turbulent, ill-disciplined life, should do the same.",OW

16202,"Endless repetition, in and out of season, has spoiled for us the freshness, the",OW

16203,"na�vet�, the simple romantic charm of the Gospels. We hear them read far too",OW

16204,"often and far too badly, and all repetition is anti-spiritual. When one returns to",OW

16205,"the Greek; it is like going into a garden of lilies out of some, narrow and dark",OW

16206,house.,OW

16207,"And to me, the pleasure is doubled by the reflection that it is extremely",OW

16208,"probable that we have the actual terms, the ipsissima verba, used by Christ. It",OW

16209,was always supposed that Christ talked in Aramaic. Even Renan thought so.,OW

16210,"But now we know that the Galilean peasants, like the Irish peasants of our",OW

16211,"own day, were bilingual, and that Greek was the ordinary language of",OW

16212,"intercourse all over Palestine, as indeed all over the Eastern world. I never",OW

16213,liked the idea that we knew of Christ�s own words only through a translation,OW

16214,of a translation. It is a delight to me to think that as far as his conversation,OW

16215,"was concerned, Charmides might have listened to him, and Socrates reasoned",OW

16216,"with him, and Plato understood him: that he really said that when he thought of the lilies of the field and how they neither toil",OW

16217,"nor spin, his absolute expression was and that his last word when he cried out �my life",OW

16218,"has been completed, has reached its fulfilment, has been perfected,� was",OW

16219,exactly as St. John tells us it was: no more.,OW

16220,"While in reading the Gospels�particularly that of St. John himself, or",OW

16221,whatever early Gnostic took his name and mantle�I see the continual,OW

16222,"assertion of the imagination as the basis of all spiritual and material life, I see",OW

16223,"also that to Christ imagination was simply a form of love, and that to him love",OW

16224,was lord in the fullest meaning of the phrase. Some six weeks ago I was,OW

16225,allowed by the doctor to have white bread to eat instead of the coarse black or,OW

16226,brown bread of ordinary prison fare. It is a great delicacy. It will sound,OW

16227,strange that dry bread could possibly be a delicacy to any one. To me it is so,OW

16228,much so that at the close of each meal I carefully eat whatever crumbs may be,OW

16229,"left on my tin plate, or have fallen on the rough towel that one uses as a cloth",OW

16230,so as not to soil one�s table; and I do so not from hunger�I get now quite,OW

16231,sufficient food�but simply in order that nothing should be wasted of what is,OW

16232,given to me. So one should look on love.,OW

16233,"Christ, like all fascinating personalities, had the power of not merely saying",OW

16234,"beautiful things himself, but of making other people say beautiful things to",OW

16235,"him; and I love the story St. Mark tells us about the Greek woman, who, when",OW

16236,as a trial of her faith he said to her that he could not give her the bread of the,OW

16237,"children of Israel, answered him that the little dogs�(�little dogs� it",OW

16238,should be rendered)�who are under the table eat of the crumbs that the,OW

16239,children let fall. Most people live for love and admiration. But it is by love,OW

16240,and admiration that we should live. If any love is shown us we should,OW

16241,recognise that we are quite unworthy of it. Nobody is worthy to be loved.,OW

16242,The fact that God loves man shows us that in the divine order of ideal things it,OW

16243,is written that eternal love is to be given to what is eternally unworthy. Or if,OW

16244,"that phrase seems to be a bitter one to bear, let us say that every one is worthy",OW

16245,"of love, except him who thinks that he is. Love is a sacrament that should be",OW

16246,"taken kneeling, and Domine, non sum dignus should be on the lips and in the",OW

16247,hearts of those who receive it.,OW

16248,"If ever I write again, in the sense of producing artistic work, there are just two",OW

16249,subjects on which and through which I desire to express myself: one is �Christ,OW

16250,as the precursor of the romantic movement in life�: the other is �The artistic,OW

16251,"life considered in its relation to conduct.� The first is, of course, intensely",OW

16252,"fascinating, for I see in Christ not merely the essentials of the supreme",OW

16253,"romantic type, but all the accidents, the wilfulnesses even, of the romantic",OW

16254,temperament also. He was the first person who ever said to people that they,OW

16255,should live �flower-like lives.� He fixed the phrase. He took children as the,OW

16256,type of what people should try to become. He held them up as examples to,OW

16257,"their elders, which I myself have always thought the chief use of children, if",OW

16258,what is perfect should have a use. Dante describes the soul of a man as,OW

16259,"coming from the hand of God �weeping and laughing like a little child,� and",OW

16260,Christ also saw that the soul of each one should be a guisa di fanciulla che,OW

16261,"piangendo e ridendo pargoleggia. He felt that life was changeful, fluid, active,",OW

16262,and that to allow it to be stereotyped into any form was death. He saw that,OW

16263,"people should not be too serious over material, common interests: that to be",OW

16264,unpractical was to be a great thing: that one should not bother too much over,OW

16265,"affairs. The birds didn�t, why should man? He is charming when he says,",OW

16266,�Take no thought for the morrow; is not the soul more than meat? is not the,OW

16267,body more than raiment?� A Greek might have used the latter phrase. It is full,OW

16268,"of Greek feeling. But only Christ could have said both, and so summed up life",OW

16269,perfectly for us.,OW

16270,"His morality is all sympathy, just what morality should be. If the only thing",OW

16271,"that he ever said had been, �Her sins are forgiven her because she loved much,�",OW

16272,it would have been worth while dying to have said it. His justice is all poetical,OW

16273,"justice, exactly what justice should be. The beggar goes to heaven because he",OW

16274,has been unhappy. I cannot conceive a better reason for his being sent there.,OW

16275,The people who work for an hour in the vineyard in the cool of the evening,OW

16276,receive just as much reward as those who have toiled there all day long in the,OW

16277,hot sun. Why shouldn�t they? Probably no one deserved anything. Or,OW

16278,perhaps they were a different kind of people. Christ had no patience with the,OW

16279,"dull lifeless mechanical systems that treat people as if they were things, and so",OW

16280,treat everybody alike: for him there were no laws: there were exceptions,OW

16281,"merely, as if anybody, or anything, for that matter, was like aught else in the",OW

16282,world!,OW

16283,That which is the very keynote of romantic art was to him the proper basis of,OW

16284,"natural life. He saw no other basis. And when they brought him one, taken in",OW

16285,"the very act of sin and showed him her sentence written in the law, and asked",OW

16286,"him what was to be done, he wrote with his finger on the ground as though he",OW

16287,"did not hear them, and finally, when they pressed him again, looked up and",OW

16288,"said, �Let him of you who has never sinned be the first to throw the stone at",OW

16289,her.� It was worthwhile living to have said that.,OW

16290,Like all poetical natures he loved ignorant people. He knew that in the soul of,OW

16291,one who is ignorant there is always room for a great idea. But he could not,OW

16292,"stand stupid people, especially those who are made stupid by education:",OW

16293,"people who are full of opinions not one of which they even understand, a",OW

16294,"peculiarly modern type, summed up by Christ when he describes it as the type",OW

16295,"of one who has the key of knowledge, cannot use it himself, and does not",OW

16296,"allow other people to use it, though it may be made to open the gate of God�s",OW

16297,Kingdom. His chief war was against the Philistines. That is the war every,OW

16298,child of light has to wage. Philistinism was the note of the age and community,OW

16299,"in which he lived. In their heavy inaccessibility to ideas, their dull",OW

16300,"respectability, their tedious orthodoxy, their worship of vulgar success, their",OW

16301,"entire preoccupation with the gross materialistic side of life, and their",OW

16302,"ridiculous estimate of themselves and their importance, the Jews of Jerusalem",OW

16303,in Christ�s day were the exact counterpart of the British Philistine of our own.,OW

16304,"Christ mocked at the �whited sepulchre� of respectability, and fixed that phrase",OW

16305,for ever. He treated worldly success as a thing absolutely to be despised. He,OW

16306,saw nothing in it at all. He looked on wealth as an encumbrance to a man. He,OW

16307,would not hear of life being sacrificed to any system of thought or morals. He,OW

16308,"pointed out that forms and ceremonies were made for man, not man for forms",OW

16309,and ceremonies. He took sabbatarianism as a type of the things that should be,OW

16310,"set at nought. The cold philanthropies, the ostentatious public charities, the",OW

16311,"tedious formalisms so dear to the middle-class mind, he exposed with utter",OW

16312,"and relentless scorn. To us, what is termed orthodoxy is merely a facile",OW

16313,"unintelligent acquiescence; but to them, and in their hands, it was a terrible",OW

16314,and paralysing tyranny. Christ swept it aside. He showed that the spirit alone,OW

16315,was of value. He took a keen pleasure in pointing out to them that though they,OW

16316,"were always reading the law and the prophets, they had not really the smallest",OW

16317,idea of what either of them meant. In opposition to their tithing of each,OW

16318,"separate day into the fixed routine of prescribed duties, as they tithe mint and",OW

16319,"rue, he preached the enormous importance of living completely for the",OW

16320,moment.,OW

16321,Those whom he saved from their sins are saved simply for beautiful moments,OW

16322,"in their lives. Mary Magdalen, when she sees Christ, breaks the rich vase of",OW

16323,"alabaster that one of her seven lovers had given her, and spills the odorous",OW

16324,"spices over his tired dusty feet, and for that one moment�s sake sits for ever",OW

16325,with Ruth and Beatrice in the tresses of the snow-white rose of Paradise. All,OW

16326,that Christ says to us by the way of a little warning is that every moment,OW

16327,"should be beautiful, that the soul should always be ready for the coming of the",OW

16328,"bridegroom, always waiting for the voice of the lover, Philistinism being",OW

16329,simply that side of man�s nature that is not illumined by the imagination. He,OW

16330,sees all the lovely influences of life as modes of light: the imagination itself is,OW

16331,"the world of light. The world is made by it, and yet the world cannot",OW

16332,understand it: that is because the imagination is simply a manifestation of,OW

16333,"love, and it is love and the capacity for it that distinguishes one human being",OW

16334,from another.,OW

16335,"But it is when he deals with a sinner that Christ is most romantic, in the sense",OW

16336,of most real. The world had always loved the saint as being the nearest,OW

16337,"possible approach to the perfection of God. Christ, through some divine",OW

16338,"instinct in him, seems to have always loved the sinner as being the nearest",OW

16339,possible approach to the perfection of man. His primary desire was not to,OW

16340,"reform people, any more than his primary desire was to a relieve suffering. To",OW

16341,turn an interesting thief into a tedious honest man was not his aim. He would,OW

16342,have thought little of the Prisoners� Aid Society and other modern movements,OW

16343,of the kind. The conversion of a publican into a Pharisee would not have,OW

16344,seemed to him a great achievement. But in a manner not yet understood of the,OW

16345,world he regarded sin and suffering as being in themselves beautiful holy,OW

16346,things and modes of perfection.,OW

16347,It seems a very dangerous idea. It is�all great ideas are dangerous. That it,OW

16348,was Christ�s creed admits of no doubt. That it is the true creed I don�t doubt,OW

16349,myself.,OW

16350,Of course the sinner must repent. But why? Simply because otherwise he,OW

16351,would be unable to realise what he had done. The moment of repentance is,OW

16352,the moment of initiation. More than that: it is the means by which one alters,OW

16353,one�s past. The Greeks thought that impossible. They often say in their,OW

16354,"Gnomic aphorisms, �Even the Gods cannot alter the past.� Christ showed that",OW

16355,"the commonest sinner could do it, that it was the one thing he could do.",OW

16356,"Christ, had he been asked, would have said�I feel quite certain about it�that",OW

16357,"the moment the prodigal son fell on his knees and wept, he made his having",OW

16358,"wasted his substance with harlots, his swine-herding and hungering for the",OW

16359,"husks they ate, beautiful and holy moments in his life. It is difficult for most",OW

16360,people to grasp the idea. I dare say one has to go to prison to understand it. If,OW

16361,"so, it may be worth while going to prison.",OW

16362,There is something so unique about Christ. Of course just as there are false,OW

16363,"dawns before the dawn itself, and winter days so full of sudden sunlight that",OW

16364,"they will cheat the wise crocus into squandering its gold before its time, and",OW

16365,"make some foolish bird call to its mate to build on barren boughs, so there",OW

16366,were Christians before Christ. For that we should be grateful. The,OW

16367,"unfortunate thing is that there have been none since. I make one exception, St.",OW

16368,"Francis of Assisi. But then God had given him at his birth the soul of a poet,",OW

16369,as he himself when quite young had in mystical marriage taken poverty as his,OW

16370,bride: and with the soul of a poet and the body of a beggar he found the way to,OW

16371,"perfection not difficult. He understood Christ, and so he became like him. We",OW

16372,do not require the Liber Conformitatum to teach us that the life of St. Francis,OW

16373,"was the true Imitatio Christi, a poem compared to which the book of that name",OW

16374,is merely prose.,OW

16375,"Indeed, that is the charm about Christ, when all is said: he is just like a work",OW

16376,"of art. He does not really teach one anything, but by being brought into his",OW

16377,presence one becomes something. And everybody is predestined to his,OW

16378,presence. Once at least in his life each man walks with Christ to Emmaus.,OW

16379,"As regards the other subject, the Relation of the Artistic Life to Conduct, it",OW

16380,will no doubt seem strange to you that I should select it. People point to,OW

16381,"Reading Gaol and say, �That is where the artistic life leads a man.� Well, it",OW

16382,might lead to worse places. The more mechanical people to whom life is a,OW

16383,"shrewd speculation depending on a careful calculation of ways and means,",OW

16384,"always know where they are going, and go there. They start with the ideal",OW

16385,"desire of being the parish beadle, and in whatever sphere they are placed they",OW

16386,succeed in being the parish beadle and no more. A man whose desire is to be,OW

16387,"something separate from himself, to be a member of Parliament, or a",OW

16388,"successful grocer, or a prominent solicitor, or a judge, or something equally",OW

16389,"tedious, invariably succeeds in being what he wants to be. That is his",OW

16390,punishment. Those who want a mask have to wear it.,OW

16391,"But with the dynamic forces of life, and those in whom those dynamic forces",OW

16392,"become incarnate, it is different. People whose desire is solely for selfrealisation never know where they are going. They can�t know. In one sense",OW

16393,"of the word it is of course necessary, as the Greek oracle said, to know oneself:",OW

16394,that is the first achievement of knowledge. But to recognise that the soul of a,OW

16395,"man is unknowable, is the ultimate achievement of wisdom. The final mystery",OW

16396,"is oneself. When one has weighed the sun in the balance, and measured the",OW

16397,"steps of the moon, and mapped out the seven heavens star by star, there still",OW

16398,remains oneself. Who can calculate the orbit of his own soul? When the son,OW

16399,"went out to look for his father�s asses, he did not know that a man of God was",OW

16400,"waiting for him with the very chrism of coronation, and that his own soul was",OW

16401,already the soul of a king.,OW

16402,I hope to live long enough and to produce work of such a character that I shall,OW

16403,"be able at the end of my days to say, �Yes! this is just where the artistic life",OW

16404,leads a man!� Two of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own,OW

16405,experience are the lives of Verlaine and of Prince Kropotkin: both of them,OW

16406,"men who have passed years in prison: the first, the one Christian poet since",OW

16407,"Dante; the other, a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ which seems",OW

16408,"coming out of Russia. And for the last seven or eight months, in spite of a",OW

16409,succession of great troubles reaching me from the outside world almost,OW

16410,"without intermission, I have been placed in direct contact with a new spirit",OW

16411,"working in this prison through man and things, that has helped me beyond any",OW

16412,possibility of expression in words: so that while for the first year of my,OW

16413,"imprisonment I did nothing else, and can remember doing nothing else, but",OW

16414,"wring my hands in impotent despair, and say, �What an ending, what an",OW

16415,"appalling ending!� now I try to say to myself, and sometimes when I am not",OW

16416,"torturing myself do really and sincerely say, �What a beginning, what a",OW

16417,wonderful beginning!� It may really be so. It may become so. If it does I shall,OW

16418,owe much to this new personality that has altered every man�s life in this,OW

16419,place.,OW

16420,"You may realise it when I say that had I been released last May, as I tried to",OW

16421,"be, I would have left this place loathing it and every official in it with a",OW

16422,bitterness of hatred that would have poisoned my life. I have had a year,OW

16423,"longer of imprisonment, but humanity has been in the prison along with us all,",OW

16424,and now when I go out I shall always remember great kindnesses that I have,OW

16425,"received here from almost everybody, and on the day of my release I shall give",OW

16426,"many thanks to many people, and ask to be remembered by them in turn.",OW

16427,The prison style is absolutely and entirely wrong. I would give anything to be,OW

16428,able to alter it when I go out. I intend to try. But there is nothing in the world,OW

16429,"so wrong but that the spirit of humanity, which is the spirit of love, the spirit of",OW

16430,"the Christ who is not in churches, may make it, if not right, at least possible to",OW

16431,be borne without too much bitterness of heart.,OW

16432,"I know also that much is waiting for me outside that is very delightful, from",OW

16433,"what St. Francis of Assisi calls �my brother the wind, and my sister the rain,�",OW

16434,"lovely things both of them, down to the shop-windows and sunsets of great",OW

16435,"cities. If I made a list of all that still remains to me, I don�t know where I",OW

16436,"should stop: for, indeed, God made the world just as much for me as for any",OW

16437,one else. Perhaps I may go out with something that I had not got before. I,OW

16438,need not tell you that to me reformations in morals are as meaningless and,OW

16439,vulgar as Reformations in theology. But while to propose to be a better man is,OW

16440,"a piece of unscientific cant, to have become a deeper man is the privilege of",OW

16441,those who have suffered. And such I think I have become.,OW

16442,"If after I am free a friend of mine gave a feast, and did not invite me to it, I",OW

16443,"should not mind a bit. I can be perfectly happy by myself. With freedom,",OW

16444,"flowers, books, and the moon, who could not be perfectly happy? Besides,",OW

16445,feasts are not for me any more. I have given too many to care about them.,OW

16446,"That side of life is over for me, very fortunately, I dare say. But if after I am",OW

16447,"free a friend of mine had a sorrow and refused to allow me to share it, I should",OW

16448,"feel it most bitterly. If he shut the doors of the house of mourning against me,",OW

16449,"I would come back again and again and beg to be admitted, so that I might",OW

16450,"share in what I was entitled to share in. If he thought me unworthy, unfit to",OW

16451,"weep with him, I should feel it as the most poignant humiliation, as the most",OW

16452,terrible mode in which disgrace could be inflicted on me. But that could not,OW

16453,"be. I have a right to share in sorrow, and he who can look at the loveliness of",OW

16454,"the world and share its sorrow, and realise something of the wonder of both, is",OW

16455,"in immediate contact with divine things, and has got as near to God�s secret as",OW

16456,any one can get.,OW

16457,"Perhaps there may come into my art also, no less than into my life, a still",OW

16458,"deeper note, one of greater unity of passion, and directness of impulse. Not",OW

16459,width but intensity is the true aim of modern art. We are no longer in art,OW

16460,concerned with the type. It is with the exception that we have to do. I cannot,OW

16461,"put my sufferings into any form they took, I need hardly say. Art only begins",OW

16462,"where Imitation ends, but something must come into my work, of fuller",OW

16463,"memory of words perhaps, of richer cadences, of more curious effects, of",OW

16467,"more song, the Greek said. Apollo had been victor. The lyre had vanquished",OW

16468,the reed. But perhaps the Greeks were mistaken. I hear in much modern Art,OW

16469,"the cry of Marsyas. It is bitter in Baudelaire, sweet and plaintive in Lamartine,",OW

16470,mystic in Verlaine. It is in the deferred resolutions of Chopin�s music. It is in,OW

16471,"the discontent that haunts Burne-Jones�s women. Even Matthew Arnold,",OW

16472,"whose song of Callicles tells of �the triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre,� and",OW

16482,none. I hope at least that there is none.,OW

16483,To each of us different fates are meted out. My lot has been one of public,OW

16484,"infamy, of long imprisonment, of misery, of ruin, of disgrace, but I am not",OW

16485,"worthy of it�not yet, at any rate. I remember that I used to say that I thought I",OW

16486,could bear a real tragedy if it came to me with purple pall and a mask of noble,OW

16487,"sorrow, but that the dreadful thing about modernity was that it put tragedy into",OW

16488,"the raiment of comedy, so that the great realities seemed commonplace or",OW

16489,grotesque or lacking in style. It is quite true about modernity. It has probably,OW

16490,always been true about actual life. It is said that all martyrdoms seemed mean,OW

16491,to the looker on. The nineteenth century is no exception to the rule.,OW

16492,"Everything about my tragedy has been hideous, mean, repellent, lacking in",OW

16496,London. From two o�clock till half-past two on that day I had to stand on the,OW

16497,"centre platform of Clapham Junction in convict dress, and handcuffed, for the",OW

16498,world to look at. I had been taken out of the hospital ward without a,OW

16499,moment�s notice being given to me. Of all possible objects I was the most,OW

16500,grotesque. When people saw me they laughed. Each train as it came up,OW

16501,"swelled the audience. Nothing could exceed their amusement. That was, of",OW

16502,"course, before they knew who I was. As soon as they had been informed they",OW

16503,laughed still more. For half an hour I stood there in the grey November rain,OW

16504,surrounded by a jeering mob.,OW

16505,For a year after that was done to me I wept every day at the same hour and for,OW

16506,the same space of time. That is not such a tragic thing as possibly it sounds to,OW

16507,you. To those who are in prison tears are a part of every day�s experience. A,OW

16508,day in prison on which one does not weep is a day on which one�s heart is,OW

16509,"hard, not a day on which one�s heart is happy.",OW

16510,"Well, now I am really beginning to feel more regret for the people who",OW

16511,laughed than for myself. Of course when they saw me I was not on my,OW

16512,"pedestal, I was in the pillory. But it is a very unimaginative nature that only",OW

16513,cares for people on their pedestals. A pedestal may be a very unreal thing. A,OW

16514,pillory is a terrific reality. They should have known also how to interpret,OW

16515,sorrow better. I have said that behind sorrow there is always sorrow. It were,OW

16516,wiser still to say that behind sorrow there is always a soul. And to mock at a,OW

16517,soul in pain is a dreadful thing. In the strangely simple economy of the world,OW

16518,"people only get what they give, and to those who have not enough imagination",OW

16519,"to penetrate the mere outward of things, and feel pity, what pity can be given",OW

16520,save that of scorn?,OW

16521,I write this account of the mode of my being transferred here simply that it,OW

16522,should be realised how hard it has been for me to get anything out of my,OW

16523,"punishment but bitterness and despair. I have, however, to do it, and now and",OW

16524,then I have moments of submission and acceptance. All the spring may be,OW

16525,"hidden in the single bud, and the low ground nest of the lark may hold the joy",OW

16526,that is to herald the feet of many rose-red dawns. So perhaps whatever beauty,OW

16527,"of life still remains to me is contained in some moment of surrender,",OW

16528,"abasement, and humiliation. I can, at any rate, merely proceed on the lines of",OW

16529,"my own development, and, accepting all that has happened to me, make",OW

16530,myself worthy of it.,OW

16531,People used to say of me that I was too individualistic. I must be far more of,OW

16532,an individualist than ever I was. I must get far more out of myself than ever I,OW

16533,"got, and ask far less of the world than ever I asked. Indeed, my ruin came not",OW

16534,"from too great individualism of life, but from too little. The one disgraceful,",OW

16535,"unpardonable, and to all time contemptible action of my life was to allow",OW

16536,myself to appeal to society for help and protection. To have made such an,OW

16537,"appeal would have been from the individualist point of view bad enough, but",OW

16538,what excuse can there ever be put forward for having made it? Of course once,OW

16539,"I had put into motion the forces of society, society turned on me and said,",OW

16540,"�Have you been living all this time in defiance of my laws, and do you now",OW

16541,appeal to those laws for protection? You shall have those laws exercised to,OW

16542,the full. You shall abide by what you have appealed to.� The result is I am in,OW

16543,"gaol. Certainly no man ever fell so ignobly, and by such ignoble instruments,",OW

16544,as I did.,OW

16545,The Philistine element in life is not the failure to understand art. Charming,OW

16546,"people, such as fishermen, shepherds, ploughboys, peasants and the like, know",OW

16547,"nothing about art, and are the very salt of the earth. He is the Philistine who",OW

16548,"upholds and aids the heavy, cumbrous, blind, mechanical forces of society, and",OW

16549,who does not recognise dynamic force when he meets it either in a man or a,OW

16550,movement.,OW

16551,People thought it dreadful of me to have entertained at dinner the evil things of,OW

16552,"life, and to have found pleasure in their company. But then, from the point of",OW

16553,"view through which I, as an artist in life, approach them they were delightfully",OW

16554,suggestive and stimulating. The danger was half the excitement. . . . My,OW

16555,business as an artist was with Ariel. I set myself to wrestle with Caliban. . . .,OW

16556,A great friend of mine�a friend of ten years� standing�came to see me some,OW

16557,"time ago, and told me that he did not believe a single word of what was said",OW

16558,"against me, and wished me to know that he considered me quite innocent, and",OW

16559,"the victim of a hideous plot. I burst into tears at what he said, and told him",OW

16560,that while there was much amongst the definite charges that was quite untrue,OW

16561,"and transferred to me by revolting malice, still that my life had been full of",OW

16562,"perverse pleasures, and that unless he accepted that as a fact about me and",OW

16563,"realised it to the full I could not possibly be friends with him anymore, or ever",OW

16564,"be in his company. It was a terrible shock to him, but we are friends, and I",OW

16565,have not got his friendship on false pretences.,OW

16566,"Emotional forces, as I say somewhere in Intentions, are as limited in extent",OW

16567,and duration as the forces of physical energy. The little cup that is made to,OW

16568,"hold so much can hold so much and no more, though all the purple vats of",OW

16569,"Burgundy be filled with wine to the brim, and the treaders stand knee-deep in",OW

16570,the gathered grapes of the stony vineyards of Spain. There is no error more,OW

16571,common than that of thinking that those who are the causes or occasions of,OW

16572,great tragedies share in the feelings suitable to the tragic mood: no error more,OW

16573,fatal than expecting it of them. The martyr in his �shirt of flame� may be,OW

16574,"looking on the face of God, but to him who is piling the faggots or loosening",OW

16575,the logs for the blast the whole scene is no more than the slaying of an ox is to,OW

16576,"the butcher, or the felling of a tree to the charcoal burner in the forest, or the",OW

16577,fall of a flower to one who is mowing down the grass with a scythe. Great,OW

16578,"passions are for the great of soul, and great events can be seen only by those",OW

16579,who are on a level with them.,OW

16580,I know of nothing in all drama more incomparable from the point of view of,OW

16581,"art, nothing more suggestive in its subtlety of observation, than Shakespeare�s",OW

16582,drawing of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They are Hamlet�s college friends.,OW

16583,They have been his companions. They bring with them memories of pleasant,OW

16584,days together. At the moment when they come across him in the play he is,OW

16585,staggering under the weight of a burden intolerable to one of his temperament.,OW

16586,The dead have come armed out of the grave to impose on him a mission at,OW

16587,"once too great and too mean for him. He is a dreamer, and he is called upon to",OW

16588,"act. He has the nature of the poet, and he is asked to grapple with the common",OW

16589,"complexity of cause and effect, with life in its practical realisation, of which",OW

16590,"he knows nothing, not with life in its ideal essence, of which he knows so",OW

16591,"much. He has no conception of what to do, and his folly is to feign folly.",OW

16592,"Brutus used madness as a cloak to conceal the sword of his purpose, the",OW

16593,"dagger of his will, but the Hamlet madness is a mere mask for the hiding of",OW

16594,weakness. In the making of fancies and jests he sees a chance of delay. He,OW

16595,keeps playing with action as an artist plays with a theory. He makes himself,OW

16596,"the spy of his proper actions, and listening to his own words knows them to be",OW

16597,"but �words, words, words.� Instead of trying to be the hero of his own history,",OW

16598,"he seeks to be the spectator of his own tragedy. He disbelieves in everything,",OW

16599,"including himself, and yet his doubt helps him not, as it comes not from",OW

16600,scepticism but from a divided will.,OW

16601,Of all this Guildenstern and Rosencrantz realise nothing. They bow and smirk,OW

16602,"and smile, and what the one says the other echoes with sickliest intonation.",OW

16603,"When, at last, by means of the play within the play, and the puppets in their",OW

16604,"dalliance, Hamlet �catches the conscience� of the King, and drives the",OW

16605,"wretched man in terror from his throne, Guildenstern and Rosencrantz see no",OW

16606,more in his conduct than a rather painful breach of Court etiquette. That is as,OW

16607,far as they can attain to in �the contemplation of the spectacle of life with,OW

16608,appropriate emotions.� They are close to his very secret and know nothing of,OW

16609,it. Nor would there be any use in telling them. They are the little cups that,OW

16610,"can hold so much and no more. Towards the close it is suggested that, caught",OW

16611,"in a cunning spring set for another, they have met, or may meet, with a violent",OW

16612,"and sudden death. But a tragic ending of this kind, though touched by",OW

16613,"Hamlet�s humour with something of the surprise and justice of comedy, is",OW

16614,"really not for such as they. They never die. Horatio, who in order to �report",OW

16615,"Hamlet and his cause aright to the unsatisfied,�",OW

16616,"�Absents him from felicity a while,",OW

16617,"And in this harsh world draws his breath in pain,�",OW

16618,"dies, but Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are as immortal as Angelo and",OW

16619,"Tartuffe, and should rank with them. They are what modern life has",OW

16620,contributed to the antique ideal of friendship. He who writes a new De,OW

16621,"Amicitia must find a niche for them, and praise them in Tusculan prose. They",OW

16622,are types fixed for all time. To censure them would show �a lack of,OW

16623,appreciation.� They are merely out of their sphere: that is all. In sublimity of,OW

16624,soul there is no contagion. High thoughts and high emotions are by their very,OW

16625,existence isolated.,OW

16626,"I am to be released, if all goes well with me, towards the end of May, and hope",OW

16627,to go at once to some little sea-side village abroad with R--- and M---.,OW

16628,"The sea, as Euripides says in one of his plays about Iphigeneia, washes away",OW

16629,the stains and wounds of the world.,OW

16630,"I hope to be at least a month with my friends, and to gain peace and balance,",OW

16631,"and a less troubled heart, and a sweeter mood. I have a strange longing for the",OW

16632,"great simple primeval things, such as the sea, to me no less of a mother than",OW

16633,"the Earth. It seems to me that we all look at Nature too much, and live with",OW

16634,her too little. I discern great sanity in the Greek attitude. They never chattered,OW

16635,"about sunsets, or discussed whether the shadows on the grass were really",OW

16636,"mauve or not. But they saw that the sea was for the swimmer, and the sand for",OW

16637,"the feet of the runner. They loved the trees for the shadow that they cast, and",OW

16638,the forest for its silence at noon. The vineyard-dresser wreathed his hair with,OW

16639,ivy that he might keep off the rays of the sun as he stooped over the young,OW

16640,"shoots, and for the artist and the athlete, the two types that Greece gave us,",OW

16641,they plaited with garlands the leaves of the bitter laurel and of the wild,OW

16642,"parsley, which else had been of no service to men.",OW

16643,"We call ours a utilitarian age, and we do not know the uses of any single thing.",OW

16644,"We have forgotten that water can cleanse, and fire purify, and that the Earth is",OW

16645,mother to us all. As a consequence our art is of the moon and plays with,OW

16646,"shadows, while Greek art is of the sun and deals directly with things. I feel",OW

16647,"sure that in elemental forces there is purification, and I want to go back to",OW

16648,them and live in their presence.,OW

16649,"Of course to one so modern as I am, �Enfant de mon si�cle,� merely to look at",OW

16650,the world will be always lovely. I tremble with pleasure when I think that on,OW

16651,the very day of my leaving prison both the laburnum and the lilac will be,OW

16652,"blooming in the gardens, and that I shall see the wind stir into restless beauty",OW

16653,"the swaying gold of the one, and make the other toss the pale purple of its",OW

16654,"plumes, so that all the air shall be Arabia for me. Linnaeus fell on his knees",OW

16655,and wept for joy when he saw for the first time the long heath of some English,OW

16656,upland made yellow with the tawny aromatic brooms of the common furze;,OW

16657,"and I know that for me, to whom flowers are part of desire, there are tears",OW

16658,waiting in the petals of some rose. It has always been so with me from my,OW

16659,"boyhood. There is not a single colour hidden away in the chalice of a flower,",OW

16660,"or the curve of a shell, to which, by some subtle sympathy with the very soul",OW

16661,"of things, my nature does not answer. Like Gautier, I have always been one of",OW

16662,those �pour qui le monde visible existe.�,OW

16663,"Still, I am conscious now that behind all this beauty, satisfying though it may",OW

16664,"be, there is some spirit hidden of which the painted forms and shapes are but",OW

16665,"modes of manifestation, and it is with this spirit that I desire to become in",OW

16666,harmony. I have grown tired of the articulate utterances of men and things.,OW

16667,"The Mystical in Art, the Mystical in Life, the Mystical in Nature this is what I",OW

16821,Nobody�s Story,CD

16822,"He lived on the bank of a mighty river, broad and deep, which was always",CD

16823,"silently rolling on to a vast undiscovered ocean. It had rolled on, ever since the",CD

16824,"world began. It had changed its course sometimes, and turned into new",CD

16825,"channels, leaving its old ways dry and barren; but it had ever been upon the",CD

16826,"flow, and ever was to flow until Time should be no more. Against its strong,",CD

16827,"unfathomable stream, nothing made head. No living creature, no flower, no",CD

16828,"leaf, no particle of animate or inanimate existence, ever strayed back from the",CD

16829,undiscovered ocean. The tide of the river set resistlessly towards it; and the,CD

16830,"tide never stopped, any more than the earth stops in its circling round the sun.",CD

16831,"He lived in a busy place, and he worked very hard to live. He had no hope",CD

16832,"of ever being rich enough to live a month without hard work, but he was quite",CD

16833,"content, GOD knows, to labour with a cheerful will. He was one of an",CD

16834,"immense family, all of whose sons and daughters gained their daily bread by",CD

16835,"daily work, prolonged from their rising up betimes until their lying down at",CD

16836,"night. Beyond this destiny he had no prospect, and he sought none.",CD

16837,"There was over-much drumming, trumpeting, and speech-making, in the",CD

16838,neighbourhood where he dwelt; but he had nothing to do with that. Such clash,CD

16839,"and uproar came from the Bigwig family, at the unaccountable proceedings of",CD

16840,"which race, he marvelled much. They set up the strangest statues, in iron,",CD

16841,"marble, bronze, and brass, before his door; and darkened his house with the",CD

16842,"legs and tails of uncouth images of horses. He wondered what it all meant,",CD

16843,"smiled in a rough good-humoured way he had, and kept at his hard work.",CD

16844,"The Bigwig family (composed of all the stateliest people thereabouts, and",CD

16845,"all the noisiest) had undertaken to save him the trouble of thinking for himself,",CD

16846,"and to manage him and his affairs. ""Why truly,"" said he, ""I have little time",CD

16847,"upon my hands; and if you will be so good as to take care of me, in return for",CD

16848,"the money I pay over""--for the Bigwig family were not above his money--""I",CD

16849,"shall be relieved and much obliged, considering that you know best."" Hence",CD

16850,"the drumming, trumpeting, and speech-making, and the ugly images of horses",CD

16851,which he was expected to fall down and worship.,CD

16852,"""I don't understand all this,"" said he, rubbing his furrowed brow",CD

16853,"confusedly. ""But it HAS a meaning, maybe, if I could find it out.""",CD

16854,"""It means,"" returned the Bigwig family, suspecting something of what he",CD

16855,"said, ""honour and glory in the highest, to the highest merit.""",CD

16856,"""Oh!"" said he. And he was glad to hear that.",CD

16857,"But, when he looked among the images in iron, marble, bronze, and brass,",CD

16858,"he failed to find a rather meritorious countryman of his, once the son of a",CD

16859,"Warwickshire wool-dealer, or any single countryman whomsoever of that",CD

16860,kind. He could find none of the men whose knowledge had rescued him and,CD

16861,"his children from terrific and disfiguring disease, whose boldness had raised",CD

16862,"his forefathers from the condition of serfs, whose wise fancy had opened a",CD

16863,"new and high existence to the humblest, whose skill had filled the working",CD

16864,"man's world with accumulated wonders. Whereas, he did find others whom he",CD

16865,"knew no good of, and even others whom he knew much ill of.",CD

16866,"""Humph!"" said he. ""I don't quite understand it.""",CD

16867,"So, he went home, and sat down by his fireside to get it out of his mind.",CD

16868,"Now, his fireside was a bare one, all hemmed in by blackened streets; but it",CD

16869,"was a precious place to him. The hands of his wife were hardened with toil,",CD

16870,"and she was old before her time; but she was dear to him. His children, stunted",CD

16871,"in their growth, bore traces of unwholesome nurture; but they had beauty in",CD

16872,"his sight. Above all other things, it was an earnest desire of this man's soul that",CD

16873,"his children should be taught. ""If I am sometimes misled,"" said he, ""for want",CD

16874,"of knowledge, at least let them know better, and avoid my mistakes. If it is",CD

16875,hard to me to reap the harvest of pleasure and instruction that is stored in,CD

16876,"books, let it be easier to them.""",CD

16877,"But, the Bigwig family broke out into violent family quarrels concerning",CD

16878,what it was lawful to teach to this man's children. Some of the family insisted,CD

16879,on such a thing being primary and indispensable above all other things; and,CD

16880,others of the family insisted on such another thing being primary and,CD

16881,"indispensable above all other things; and the Bigwig family, rent into factions,",CD

16882,"wrote pamphlets, held convocations, delivered charges, orations, and all",CD

16883,varieties of discourses; impounded one another in courts Lay and courts,CD

16884,"Ecclesiastical; threw dirt, exchanged pummelings, and fell together by the ears",CD

16885,"in unintelligible animosity. Meanwhile, this man, in his short evening snatches",CD

16886,"at his fireside, saw the demon Ignorance arise there, and take his children to",CD

16887,"itself. He saw his daughter perverted into a heavy, slatternly drudge; he saw",CD

16888,"his son go moping down the ways of low sensuality, to brutality and crime; he",CD

16889,saw the dawning light of intelligence in the eyes of his babies so changing into,CD

16890,"cunning and suspicion, that he could have rather wished them idiots.",CD

16891,"""I don't understand this any the better,"" said he; ""but I think it cannot be",CD

16892,"right. Nay, by the clouded Heaven above me, I protest against this as my",CD

16893,"wrong!""",CD

16894,"Becoming peaceable again (for his passion was usually short-lived, and his",CD

16895,"nature kind), he looked about him on his Sundays and holidays, and he saw",CD

16896,"how much monotony and weariness there was, and thence how drunkenness",CD

16897,"arose with all its train of ruin. Then he appealed to the Bigwig family, and",CD

16898,"said, ""We are a labouring people, and I have a glimmering suspicion in me that",CD

16899,labouring people of whatever condition were made--by a higher intelligence,CD

16900,"than yours, as I poorly understand it--to be in need of mental refreshment and",CD

16901,"recreation. See what we fall into, when we rest without it. Come! Amuse me",CD

16902,"harmlessly, show me something, give me an escape!""",CD

16903,"But, here the Bigwig family fell into a state of uproar absolutely deafening.",CD

16904,"When some few voices were faintly heard, proposing to show him the",CD

16905,"wonders of the world, the greatness of creation, the mighty changes of time,",CD

16906,"the workings of nature and the beauties of art--to show him these things, that",CD

16907,"is to say, at any period of his life when he could look upon them--there arose",CD

16908,"among the Bigwigs such roaring and raving, such pulpiting and petitioning,",CD

16909,"such maundering and memorialising, such name-calling and dirt-throwing,",CD

16910,"such a shrill wind of parliamentary questioning and feeble replying- -where ""I",CD

16911,"dare not"" waited on ""I would""--that the poor fellow stood aghast, staring",CD

16912,wildly around.,CD

16913,"""Have I provoked all this,"" said he, with his hands to his affrighted ears,",CD

16914,"""by what was meant to be an innocent request, plainly arising out of my",CD

16915,"familiar experience, and the common knowledge of all men who choose to",CD

16916,"open their eyes? I don't understand, and I am not understood. What is to come",CD

16917,"of such a state of things!""",CD

16918,"He was bending over his work, often asking himself the question, when the",CD

16919,"news began to spread that a pestilence had appeared among the labourers, and",CD

16920,"was slaying them by thousands. Going forth to look about him, he soon found",CD

16921,this to be true. The dying and the dead were mingled in the close and tainted,CD

16922,houses among which his life was passed. New poison was distilled into the,CD

16923,"always murky, always sickening air. The robust and the weak, old age and",CD

16924,"infancy, the father and the mother, all were stricken down alike.",CD

16925,"What means of flight had he? He remained there, where he was, and saw",CD

16926,"those who were dearest to him die. A kind preacher came to him, and would",CD

16927,"have said some prayers to soften his heart in his gloom, but he replied:",CD

16928,"""O what avails it, missionary, to come to me, a man condemned to",CD

16929,"residence in this foetid place, where every sense bestowed upon me for my",CD

16930,"delight becomes a torment, and where every minute of my numbered days is",CD

16931,"new mire added to the heap under which I lie oppressed! But, give me my first",CD

16932,"glimpse of Heaven, through a little of its light and air; give me pure water;",CD

16933,"help me to be clean; lighten this heavy atmosphere and heavy life, in which",CD

16934,"our spirits sink, and we become the indifferent and callous creatures you too",CD

16935,"often see us; gently and kindly take the bodies of those who die among us, out",CD

16936,of the small room where we grow to be so familiar with the awful change that,CD

16937,"even its sanctity is lost to us; and, Teacher, then I will hear--none know better",CD

16938,"than you, how willingly- -of Him whose thoughts were so much with the poor,",CD

16939,"and who had compassion for all human sorrow!""",CD

16940,"He was at work again, solitary and sad, when his Master came and stood",CD

16941,"near to him dressed in black. He, also, had suffered heavily. His young wife,",CD

16942,"his beautiful and good young wife, was dead; so, too, his only child.",CD

16943,"""Master, 'tis hard to bear--I know it--but be comforted. I would give you",CD

16944,"comfort, if I could.""",CD

16945,"The Master thanked him from his heart, but, said he, ""O you labouring",CD

16946,men! The calamity began among you. If you had but lived more healthily and,CD

16947,"decently, I should not be the widowed and bereft mourner that I am this day.""",CD

16948,"""Master,"" returned the other, shaking his head, ""I have begun to understand",CD

16950,"will stop at our poor doors, until we are united with that great squabbling",CD

16951,"family yonder, to do the things that are right. We cannot live healthily and",CD

16952,"decently, unless they who undertook to manage us provide the means. We",CD

16953,"cannot be instructed unless they will teach us; we cannot be rationally amused,",CD

16954,"unless they will amuse us; we cannot but have some false gods of our own,",CD

16955,while they set up so many of theirs in all the public places. The evil,CD

16956,"consequences of imperfect instruction, the evil consequences of pernicious",CD

16957,"neglect, the evil consequences of unnatural restraint and the denial of",CD

16958,"humanising enjoyments, will all come from us, and none of them will stop",CD

16959,with us. They will spread far and wide. They always do; they always have,CD

16960,"done--just like the pestilence. I understand so much, I think, at last.""",CD

16961,"But the Master said again, ""O you labouring men! How seldom do we ever",CD

16963,"""Master,"" he replied, ""I am Nobody, and little likely to be heard of (nor yet",CD

16964,"much wanted to be heard of, perhaps), except when there is some trouble. But",CD

16965,"it never begins with me, and it never can end with me. As sure as Death, it",CD

16966,"comes down to me, and it goes up from me.""",CD

16967,"There was so much reason in what he said, that the Bigwig family, getting",CD

16968,"wind of it, and being horribly frightened by the late desolation, resolved to",CD

16969,"unite with him to do the things that were right--at all events, so far as the said",CD

16970,"things were associated with the direct prevention, humanly speaking, of",CD

16971,"another pestilence. But, as their fear wore off, which it soon began to do, they",CD

16972,"resumed their falling out among themselves, and did nothing. Consequently",CD

16973,the scourge appeared again--low down as before--and spread avengingly,CD

16974,"upward as before, and carried off vast numbers of the brawlers. But not a man",CD

16975,"among them ever admitted, if in the least degree he ever perceived, that he had",CD

16985,"and one hundred and thirty rank and file, who fell in the discharge of their",CD

16986,duty on the memorable day. The story of Nobody is the story of the rank and,CD

16987,file of the earth. They bear their share of the battle; they have their part in the,CD

16988,victory; they fall; they leave no name but in the mass. The march of the,CD

16989,"proudest of us, leads to the dusty way by which they go. O! Let us think of",CD

16995,"be more correct if ""John our esteemed host"" (whose health he begged to drink)",CD

16996,"would have the kindness to begin. For as to himself, he said, he was so little",CD

16999,"begin, he left off rubbing his hands, and took his legs out from under his",CD

17000,"armchair, and did begin.",CD

17001,I have no doubt (said the poor relation) that I shall surprise the assembled,CD

17007,relate.,CD

17008,I am not what I am supposed to be. I am quite another thing. Perhaps,CD

17009,"before I go further, I had better glance at what I AM supposed to be.",CD

17010,"It is supposed, unless I mistake--the assembled members of our family will",CD

17011,"correct me if I do, which is very likely (here the poor relation looked mildly",CD

17012,about him for contradiction); that I am nobody's enemy but my own. That I,CD

17013,never met with any particular success in anything. That I failed in business,CD

17014,because I was unbusiness-like and credulous--in not being prepared for the,CD

17016,ridiculously trustful--in thinking it impossible that Christiana could deceive,CD

17017,"me. That I failed in my expectations from my uncle Chill, on account of not",CD

17018,"being as sharp as he could have wished in worldly matters. That, through life,",CD

17019,I have been rather put upon and disappointed in a general way. That I am at,CD

17020,"present a bachelor of between fifty-nine and sixty years of age, living on a",CD

17021,"limited income in the form of a quarterly allowance, to which I see that John",CD

17022,our esteemed host wishes me to make no further allusion.,CD

17023,The supposition as to my present pursuits and habits is to the following,CD

17024,effect.,CD

17025,"I live in a lodging in the Clapham Road--a very clean back room, in a very",CD

17026,"respectable house--where I am expected not to be at home in the day-time,",CD

17027,"unless poorly; and which I usually leave in the morning at nine o'clock, on",CD

17028,"pretence of going to business. I take my breakfast--my roll and butter, and my",CD

17029,half-pint of coffee--at the old-established coffee-shop near Westminster,CD

17030,Bridge; and then I go into the City--I don't know why--and sit in Garraway's,CD

17031,"Coffee House, and on 'Change, and walk about, and look into a few offices",CD

17032,and counting-houses where some of my relations or acquaintance are so good,CD

17033,"as to tolerate me, and where I stand by the fire if the weather happens to be",CD

17034,"cold. I get through the day in this way until five o'clock, and then I dine: at a",CD

17035,"cost, on the average, of one and threepence. Having still a little money to",CD

17036,"spend on my evening's entertainment, I look into the old-established coffeeshop as I go home, and take my cup of tea, and perhaps my bit of toast. So, as",CD

17045,"good suit of black on (or rather Oxford mixture, which has the appearance of",CD

17048,an attractive companion.,CD

17049,"The only exception to this general rule is the child of my first cousin, Little",CD

17050,"Frank. I have a particular affection for that child, and he takes very kindly to",CD

17051,"me. He is a diffident boy by nature; and in a crowd he is soon run over, as I",CD

17052,"may say, and forgotten. He and I, however, get on exceedingly well. I have a",CD

17053,fancy that the poor child will in time succeed to my peculiar position in the,CD

17054,"family. We talk but little; still, we understand each other. We walk about, hand",CD

17055,"in hand; and without much speaking he knows what I mean, and I know what",CD

17056,"he means. When he was very little indeed, I used to take him to the windows",CD

17057,"of the toy-shops, and show him the toys inside. It is surprising how soon he",CD

17058,found out that I would have made him a great many presents if I had been in,CD

17059,circumstances to do it.,CD

17062,"On two of my birthdays, we have dined on e-la-mode beef, and gone at halfprice to the play, and been deeply interested. I was once walking with him in",CD

17063,"Lombard Street, which we often visit on account of my having mentioned to",CD

17064,him that there are great riches there--he is very fond of Lombard Street--when,CD

17065,"a gentleman said to me as he passed by, ""Sir, your little son has dropped his",CD

17066,"glove."" I assure you, if you will excuse my remarking on so trivial a",CD

17067,"circumstance, this accidental mention of the child as mine, quite touched my",CD

17068,heart and brought the foolish tears into my eyes.,CD

17069,"When Little Frank is sent to school in the country, I shall be very much at a",CD

17070,"loss what to do with myself, but I have the intention of walking down there",CD

17071,once a month and seeing him on a half holiday. I am told he will then be at,CD

17072,"play upon the Heath; and if my visits should be objected to, as unsettling the",CD

17073,"child, I can see him from a distance without his seeing me, and walk back",CD

17074,"again. His mother comes of a highly genteel family, and rather disapproves, I",CD

17075,"am aware, of our being too much together. I know that I am not calculated to",CD

17076,improve his retiring disposition; but I think he would miss me beyond the,CD

17077,feeling of the moment if we were wholly separated.,CD

17078,"When I die in the Clapham Road, I shall not leave much more in this world",CD

17079,"than I shall take out of it; but, I happen to have a miniature of a bright-faced",CD

17080,"boy, with a curling head, and an open shirt-frill waving down his bosom (my",CD

17081,"mother had it taken for me, but I can't believe that it was ever like), which will",CD

17082,"be worth nothing to sell, and which I shall beg may he given to Frank. I have",CD

17083,"written my dear boy a little letter with it, in which I have told him that I felt",CD

17084,"very sorry to part from him, though bound to confess that I knew no reason",CD

17085,"why I should remain here. I have given him some short advice, the best in my",CD

17086,"power, to take warning of the consequences of being nobody's enemy but his",CD

17087,own; and I have endeavoured to comfort him for what I fear he will consider a,CD

17088,"bereavement, by pointing out to him, that I was only a superfluous something",CD

17089,to every one but him; and that having by some means failed to find a place in,CD

17090,"this great assembly, I am better out of it.",CD

17091,"Such (said the poor relation, clearing his throat and beginning to speak a",CD

17092,"little louder) is the general impression about me. Now, it is a remarkable",CD

17093,"circumstance which forms the aim and purpose of my story, that this is all",CD

17094,"wrong. This is not my life, and these are not my habits. I do not even live in",CD

17095,"the Clapham Road. Comparatively speaking, I am very seldom there. I reside,",CD

17096,"mostly, in a--I am almost ashamed to say the word, it sounds so full of",CD

17097,"pretension--in a Castle. I do not mean that it is an old baronial habitation, but",CD

17098,"still it is a building always known to every one by the name of a Castle. In it, I",CD

17099,preserve the particulars of my history; they run thus:,CD

17100,It was when I first took John Spatter (who had been my clerk) into,CD

17101,"partnership, and when I was still a young man of not more than five- andtwenty, residing in the house of my uncle Chill, from whom I had considerable",CD

17102,"expectations, that I ventured to propose to Christiana. I had loved Christiana a",CD

17103,"long time. She was very beautiful, and very winning in all respects. I rather",CD

17104,"mistrusted her widowed mother, who I feared was of a plotting and mercenary",CD

17105,"turn of mind; but, I thought as well of her as I could, for Christiana's sake. I",CD

17106,"never had loved any one but Christiana, and she had been all the world, and O",CD

17107,"far more than all the world, to me, from our childhood!",CD

17108,"Christiana accepted me with her mother's consent, and I was rendered very",CD

17109,"happy indeed. My life at my uncle Chill's was of a spare dull kind, and my",CD

17110,"garret chamber was as dull, and bare, and cold, as an upper prison room in",CD

17111,"some stern northern fortress. But, having Christiana's love, I wanted nothing",CD

17112,upon earth. I would not have changed my lot with any human being.,CD

17113,"Avarice was, unhappily, my uncle Chill's master-vice. Though he was rich,",CD

17114,"he pinched, and scraped, and clutched, and lived miserably. As Christiana had",CD

17115,"no fortune, I was for some time a little fearful of confessing our engagement to",CD

17116,"him; but, at length I wrote him a letter, saying how it all truly was. I put it into",CD

17117,"his hand one night, on going to bed.",CD

17118,"As I came down-stairs next morning, shivering in the cold December air;",CD

17119,"colder in my uncle's unwarmed house than in the street, where the winter sun",CD

17120,"did sometimes shine, and which was at all events enlivened by cheerful faces",CD

17121,"and voices passing along; I carried a heavy heart towards the long, low",CD

17122,"breakfast-room in which my uncle sat. It was a large room with a small fire,",CD

17123,and there was a great bay window in it which the rain had marked in the night,CD

17124,"as if with the tears of houseless people. It stared upon a raw yard, with a",CD

17125,"cracked stone pavement, and some rusted iron railings half uprooted, whence",CD

17126,an ugly out-building that had once been a dissecting-room (in the time of the,CD

17127,"great surgeon who had mortgaged the house to my uncle), stared at it.",CD

17128,"We rose so early always, that at that time of the year we breakfasted by",CD

17129,"candle-light. When I went into the room, my uncle was so contracted by the",CD

17130,"cold, and so huddled together in his chair behind the one dim candle, that I did",CD

17131,not see him until I was close to the table.,CD

17132,"As I held out my hand to him, he caught up his stick (being infirm, he",CD

17133,"always walked about the house with a stick), and made a blow at me, and said,",CD

17134,"""You fool!""",CD

17135,"""Uncle,"" I returned, ""I didn't expect you to be so angry as this."" Nor had I",CD

17136,"expected it, though he was a hard and angry old man.",CD

17137,"""You didn't expect!"" said he; ""when did you ever expect? When did you",CD

17138,"ever calculate, or look forward, you contemptible dog?""",CD

17139,"""These are hard words, uncle!""",CD

17140,"""Hard words? Feathers, to pelt such an idiot as you with,"" said he. ""Here!",CD

17141,"Betsy Snap! Look at him!""",CD

17142,"Betsy Snap was a withered, hard-favoured, yellow old woman--our only",CD

17143,"domestic--always employed, at this time of the morning, in rubbing my uncle's",CD

17144,"legs. As my uncle adjured her to look at me, he put his lean grip on the crown",CD

17145,"of her head, she kneeling beside him, and turned her face towards me. An",CD

17146,"involuntary thought connecting them both with the Dissecting Room, as it",CD

17147,"must often have been in the surgeon's time, passed across my mind in the",CD

17148,midst of my anxiety.,CD

17149,"""Look at the snivelling milksop!"" said my uncle. ""Look at the baby! This is",CD

17150,"the gentleman who, people say, is nobody's enemy but his own. This is the",CD

17151,gentleman who can't say no. This is the gentleman who was making such large,CD

17152,"profits in his business that he must needs take a partner, t'other day. This is the",CD

17153,"gentleman who is going to marry a wife without a penny, and who falls into",CD

17154,"the hands of Jezabels who are speculating on my death!""",CD

17155,"I knew, now, how great my uncle's rage was; for nothing short of his being",CD

17156,"almost beside himself would have induced him to utter that concluding word,",CD

17157,which he held in such repugnance that it was never spoken or hinted at before,CD

17158,him on any account.,CD

17159,"""On my death,"" he repeated, as if he were defying me by defying his own",CD

17160,"abhorrence of the word. ""On my death--death--Death! But I'll spoil the",CD

17161,"speculation. Eat your last under this roof, you feeble wretch, and may it choke",CD

17162,"you!""",CD

17163,You may suppose that I had not much appetite for the breakfast to which I,CD

17164,"was bidden in these terms; but, I took my accustomed seat. I saw that I was",CD

17165,"repudiated henceforth by my uncle; still I could bear that very well, possessing",CD

17166,Christiana's heart.,CD

17167,"He emptied his basin of bread and milk as usual, only that he took it on his",CD

17168,knees with his chair turned away from the table where I sat. When he had,CD

17169,"done, he carefully snuffed out the candle; and the cold, slate-coloured,",CD

17170,miserable day looked in upon us.,CD

17171,"""Now, Mr. Michael,"" said he, ""before we part, I should like to have a word",CD

17172,"with these ladies in your presence.""",CD

17173,"""As you will, sir,"" I returned; ""but you deceive yourself, and wrong us,",CD

17174,"cruelly, if you suppose that there is any feeling at stake in this contract but",CD

17175,"pure, disinterested, faithful love.""",CD

17176,"To this, he only replied, ""You lie!"" and not one other word.",CD

17177,"We went, through half-thawed snow and half-frozen rain, to the house",CD

17178,where Christiana and her mother lived. My uncle knew them very well. They,CD

17179,"were sitting at their breakfast, and were surprised to see us at that hour.",CD

17180,"""Your servant, ma'am,"" said my uncle to the mother. ""You divine the",CD

17181,"purpose of my visit, I dare say, ma'am. I understand there is a world of pure,",CD

17182,"disinterested, faithful love cooped up here. I am happy to bring it all it wants,",CD

17183,"to make it complete. I bring you your son-in-law, ma'am--and you, your",CD

17184,"husband, miss. The gentleman is a perfect stranger to me, but I wish him joy",CD

17185,"of his wise bargain.""",CD

17186,"He snarled at me as he went out, and I never saw him again.",CD

17187,It is altogether a mistake (continued the poor relation) to suppose that my,CD

17188,"dear Christiana, over-persuaded and influenced by her mother, married a rich",CD

17189,"man, the dirt from whose carriage wheels is often, in these changed times,",CD

17190,"thrown upon me as she rides by. No, no. She married me.",CD

17191,"The way we came to be married rather sooner than we intended, was this. I",CD

17192,"took a frugal lodging and was saving and planning for her sake, when, one",CD

17193,"day, she spoke to me with great earnestness, and said:",CD

17194,"""My dear Michael, I have given you my heart. I have said that I loved you,",CD

17195,and I have pledged myself to be your wife. I am as much yours through all,CD

17196,changes of good and evil as if we had been married on the day when such,CD

17197,"words passed between us. I know you well, and know that if we should be",CD

17198,"separated and our union broken off, your whole life would be shadowed, and",CD

17199,"all that might, even now, be stronger in your character for the conflict with the",CD

17200,"world would then be weakened to the shadow of what it is!""",CD

17201,"""God help me, Christiana!"" said I. ""You speak the truth.""",CD

17202,"""Michael!"" said she, putting her hand in mine, in all maidenly devotion,",CD

17203,"""let us keep apart no longer. It is but for me to say that I can live contented",CD

17204,"upon such means as you have, and I well know you are happy. I say so from",CD

17205,"my heart. Strive no more alone; let us strive together. My dear Michael, it is",CD

17206,"not right that I should keep secret from you what you do not suspect, but what",CD

17207,distresses my whole life. My mother: without considering that what you have,CD

17208,"lost, you have lost for me, and on the assurance of my faith: sets her heart on",CD

17209,"riches, and urges another suit upon me, to my misery. I cannot bear this, for to",CD

17210,bear it is to be untrue to you. I would rather share your struggles than look on.,CD

17211,I want no better home than you can give me. I know that you will aspire and,CD

17212,"labour with a higher courage if I am wholly yours, and let it be so when you",CD

17213,"will!""",CD

17214,"I was blest indeed, that day, and a new world opened to me. We were",CD

17215,"married in a very little while, and I took my wife to our happy home. That was",CD

17216,the beginning of the residence I have spoken of; the Castle we have ever since,CD

17217,"inhabited together, dates from that time. All our children have been born in it.",CD

17218,"Our first child--now married--was a little girl, whom we called Christiana. Her",CD

17219,"son is so like Little Frank, that I hardly know which is which.",CD

17220,The current impression as to my partner's dealings with me is also quite,CD

17221,"erroneous. He did not begin to treat me coldly, as a poor simpleton, when my",CD

17222,uncle and I so fatally quarrelled; nor did he afterwards gradually possess,CD

17223,"himself of our business and edge me out. On the contrary, he behaved to me",CD

17224,with the utmost good faith and honour.,CD

17225,Matters between us took this turn:- On the day of my separation from my,CD

17226,"uncle, and even before the arrival at our counting-house of my trunks (which",CD

17227,"he sent after me, NOT carriage paid), I went down to our room of business, on",CD

17228,"our little wharf, overlooking the river; and there I told John Spatter what had",CD

17229,"happened. John did not say, in reply, that rich old relatives were palpable facts,",CD

17230,and that love and sentiment were moonshine and fiction. He addressed me,CD

17231,thus:,CD

17232,"""Michael,"" said John, ""we were at school together, and I generally had the",CD

17233,"knack of getting on better than you, and making a higher reputation.""",CD

17234,"""You had, John,"" I returned.",CD

17235,"""Although"" said John, ""I borrowed your books and lost them; borrowed",CD

17236,"your pocket-money, and never repaid it; got you to buy my damaged knives at",CD

17237,a higher price than I had given for them new; and to own to the windows that I,CD

17238,"had broken.""",CD

17239,"""All not worth mentioning, John Spatter,"" said I, ""but certainly true.""",CD

17240,"""When you were first established in this infant business, which promises to",CD

17245,"""And finding that I had a good head for business, and that I was really",CD

17246,"useful TO the business, you did not like to retain me in that capacity, and",CD

17247,"thought it an act of justice soon to make me your partner.""",CD

17248,"""Still less worth mentioning than any of those other little circumstances",CD

17251,"""Now, my good friend,"" said John, drawing my arm through his, as he had",CD

17252,had a habit of doing at school; while two vessels outside the windows of our,CD

17253,counting-house--which were shaped like the stern windows of a ship--went,CD

17254,"lightly down the river with the tide, as John and I might then be sailing away",CD

17255,"in company, and in trust and confidence, on our voyage of life; ""let there,",CD

17256,"under these friendly circumstances, be a right understanding between us. You",CD

17257,"are too easy, Michael. You are nobody's enemy but your own. If I were to give",CD

17258,"you that damaging character among our connexion, with a shrug, and a shake",CD

17262,"abuse that trust by keeping this piece of our common affairs in the dark, and",CD

17263,"this other piece in the light, and again this other piece in the twilight, and so",CD

17264,"on, I should strengthen my strength, and weaken your weakness, day by day,",CD

17265,"until at last I found myself on the high road to fortune, and you left behind on",CD

17267,"""Exactly so,"" said I.",CD

17268,"""To prevent this, Michael,"" said John Spatter, ""or the remotest chance of",CD

17270,"and we must have but one interest.""",CD

17271,"""My dear John Spatter,"" I assured him, ""that is precisely what I mean.""",CD

17272,"""And when you are too easy,"" pursued John, his face glowing with",CD

17273,"friendship, ""you must allow me to prevent that imperfection in your nature",CD

17274,"from being taken advantage of, by any one; you must not expect me to humour",CD

17275,"it--""",CD

17276,"""My dear John Spatter,"" I interrupted, ""I DON'T expect you to humour it. I",CD

17277,"want to correct it.""",CD

17278,"""And I, too,"" said John.",CD

17279,"""Exactly so!"" cried I. ""We both have the same end in view; and,",CD

17282,"""I am sure of it!"" returned John Spatter. And we shook hands most",CD

17283,affectionately.,CD

17284,"I took John home to my Castle, and we had a very happy day. Our",CD

17285,"partnership throve well. My friend and partner supplied what I wanted, as I",CD

17286,"had foreseen that he would, and by improving both the business and myself,",CD

17287,amply acknowledged any little rise in life to which I had helped him.,CD

17288,"I am not (said the poor relation, looking at the fire as he slowly rubbed his",CD

17289,"hands) very rich, for I never cared to be that; but I have enough, and am above",CD

17290,"all moderate wants and anxieties. My Castle is not a splendid place, but it is",CD

17291,"very comfortable, and it has a warm and cheerful air, and is quite a picture of",CD

17292,Home.,CD

17293,"Our eldest girl, who is very like her mother, married John Spatter's eldest",CD

17294,son. Our two families are closely united in other ties of attachment. It is very,CD

17295,"pleasant of an evening, when we are all assembled together--which frequently",CD

17296,"happens--and when John and I talk over old times, and the one interest there",CD

17297,has always been between us.,CD

17298,"I really do not know, in my Castle, what loneliness is. Some of our children",CD

17299,"or grandchildren are always about it, and the young voices of my descendants",CD

17300,"are delightful--O, how delightful!--to me to hear. My dearest and most devoted",CD

17301,"wife, ever faithful, ever loving, ever helpful and sustaining and consoling, is",CD

17309,"Such is my Castle, and such are the real particulars of my life therein",CD

17310,preserved. I often take Little Frank home there. He is very welcome to my,CD

17311,"grandchildren, and they play together. At this time of the year--the Christmas",CD

17312,"and New Year time--I am seldom out of my Castle. For, the associations of the",CD

17313,"season seem to hold me there, and the precepts of the season seem to teach me",CD

17314,that it is well to be there.,CD

17315,"""And the Castle is--"" observed a grave, kind voice among the company.",CD

17316,"""Yes. My Castle,"" said the poor relation, shaking his head as he still looked",CD

17317,"at the fire, ""is in the Air. John our esteemed host suggests its situation",CD

17318,accurately. My Castle is in the Air! I have done. Will you be so good as to pass,CD

17320,The Child's Story,CD

17321,"Once upon a time, a good many years ago, there was a traveller, and he set",CD

17322,"out upon a journey. It was a magic journey, and was to seem very long when",CD

17323,"he began it, and very short when he got half way through.",CD

17324,"He travelled along a rather dark path for some little time, without meeting",CD

17325,"anything, until at last he came to a beautiful child. So he said to the child,",CD

17326,"""What do you do here?"" And the child said, ""I am always at play. Come and",CD

17327,"play with me!""",CD

17328,"So, he played with that child, the whole day long, and they were very",CD

17329,"merry. The sky was so blue, the sun was so bright, the water was so sparkling,",CD

17330,"the leaves were so green, the flowers were so lovely, and they heard such",CD

17331,"singing-birds and saw so many butteries, that everything was beautiful. This",CD

17332,"was in fine weather. When it rained, they loved to watch the falling drops, and",CD

17333,"to smell the fresh scents. When it blew, it was delightful to listen to the wind,",CD

17334,"and fancy what it said, as it came rushing from its home-- where was that, they",CD

17335,"wondered!--whistling and howling, driving the clouds before it, bending the",CD

17336,"trees, rumbling in the chimneys, shaking the house, and making the sea roar in",CD

17337,"fury. But, when it snowed, that was best of all; for, they liked nothing so well",CD

17338,"as to look up at the white flakes falling fast and thick, like down from the",CD

17339,breasts of millions of white birds; and to see how smooth and deep the drift,CD

17340,was; and to listen to the hush upon the paths and roads.,CD

17341,"They had plenty of the finest toys in the world, and the most astonishing",CD

17342,"picture-books: all about scimitars and slippers and turbans, and dwarfs and",CD

17343,"giants and genii and fairies, and blue- beards and bean-stalks and riches and",CD

17344,caverns and forests and Valentines and Orsons: and all new and all true.,CD

17345,"But, one day, of a sudden, the traveller lost the child. He called to him over",CD

17346,"and over again, but got no answer. So, he went upon his road, and went on for",CD

17347,"a little while without meeting anything, until at last he came to a handsome",CD

17348,"boy. So, he said to the boy, ""What do you do here?"" And the boy said, ""I am",CD

17349,"always learning. Come and learn with me.""",CD

17350,"So he learned with that boy about Jupiter and Juno, and the Greeks and the",CD

17351,"Romans, and I don't know what, and learned more than I could tell--or he",CD

17352,"either, for he soon forgot a great deal of it. But, they were not always learning;",CD

17353,they had the merriest games that ever were played. They rowed upon the river,CD

17354,"in summer, and skated on the ice in winter; they were active afoot, and active",CD

17355,"on horseback; at cricket, and all games at ball; at prisoner's base, hare and",CD

17356,"hounds, follow my leader, and more sports than I can think of; nobody could",CD

17357,"beat them. They had holidays too, and Twelfth cakes, and parties where they",CD

17358,"danced till midnight, and real Theatres where they saw palaces of real gold",CD

17359,"and silver rise out of the real earth, and saw all the wonders of the world at",CD

17360,"once. As to friends, they had such dear friends and so many of them, that I",CD

17361,"want the time to reckon them up. They were all young, like the handsome boy,",CD

17362,and were never to be strange to one another all their lives through.,CD

17363,"Still, one day, in the midst of all these pleasures, the traveller lost the boy",CD

17364,"as he had lost the child, and, after calling to him in vain, went on upon his",CD

17365,"journey. So he went on for a little while without seeing anything, until at last",CD

17366,"he came to a young man. So, he said to the young man, ""What do you do",CD

17367,"here?"" And the young man said, ""I am always in love. Come and love with",CD

17368,"me.""",CD

17369,"So, he went away with that young man, and presently they came to one of",CD

17370,the prettiest girls that ever was seen--just like Fanny in the corner there--and,CD

17371,"she had eyes like Fanny, and hair like Fanny, and dimples like Fanny's, and",CD

17372,"she laughed and coloured just as Fanny does while I am talking about her. So,",CD

17373,"the young man fell in love directly--just as Somebody I won't mention, the",CD

17374,"first time he came here, did with Fanny. Well! he was teased sometimes--just",CD

17375,as Somebody used to be by Fanny; and they quarrelled sometimes--just as,CD

17376,"Somebody and Fanny used to quarrel; and they made it up, and sat in the dark,",CD

17377,"and wrote letters every day, and never were happy asunder, and were always",CD

17378,"looking out for one another and pretending not to, and were engaged at",CD

17379,"Christmas-time, and sat close to one another by the fire, and were going to be",CD

17380,"married very soon--all exactly like Somebody I won't mention, and Fanny!",CD

17381,"But, the traveller lost them one day, as he had lost the rest of his friends,",CD

17382,"and, after calling to them to come back, which they never did, went on upon",CD

17383,"his journey. So, he went on for a little while without seeing anything, until at",CD

17384,"last he came to a middle-aged gentleman. So, he said to the gentleman, ""What",CD

17385,"are you doing here?"" And his answer was, ""I am always busy. Come and be",CD

17386,"busy with me!""",CD

17387,"So, he began to be very busy with that gentleman, and they went on",CD

17388,"through the wood together. The whole journey was through a wood, only it",CD

17389,"had been open and green at first, like a wood in spring; and now began to be",CD

17390,"thick and dark, like a wood in summer; some of the little trees that had come",CD

17391,"out earliest, were even turning brown. The gentleman was not alone, but had a",CD

17392,"lady of about the same age with him, who was his Wife; and they had children,",CD

17393,"who were with them too. So, they all went on together through the wood,",CD

17394,"cutting down the trees, and making a path through the branches and the fallen",CD

17395,"leaves, and carrying burdens, and working hard.",CD

17396,"Sometimes, they came to a long green avenue that opened into deeper",CD

17397,"woods. Then they would hear a very little, distant voice crying, ""Father, father,",CD

17398,"I am another child! Stop for me!"" And presently they would see a very little",CD

17399,"figure, growing larger as it came along, running to join them. When it came",CD

17400,"up, they all crowded round it, and kissed and welcomed it; and then they all",CD

17401,went on together.,CD

17402,"Sometimes, they came to several avenues at once, and then they all stood",CD

17403,"still, and one of the children said, ""Father, I am going to sea,"" and another said,",CD

17404,"""Father, I am going to India,"" and another, ""Father, I am going to seek my",CD

17405,"fortune where I can,"" and another, ""Father, I am going to Heaven!"" So, with",CD

17406,"many tears at parting, they went, solitary, down those avenues, each child",CD

17407,"upon its way; and the child who went to Heaven, rose into the golden air and",CD

17408,vanished.,CD

17409,"Whenever these partings happened, the traveller looked at the gentleman,",CD

17410,"and saw him glance up at the sky above the trees, where the day was",CD

17411,"beginning to decline, and the sunset to come on. He saw, too, that his hair was",CD

17412,"turning grey. But, they never could rest long, for they had their journey to",CD

17413,"perform, and it was necessary for them to be always busy.",CD

17414,"At last, there had been so many partings that there were no children left,",CD

17415,"and only the traveller, the gentleman, and the lady, went upon their way in",CD

17416,"company. And now the wood was yellow; and now brown; and the leaves,",CD

17417,"even of the forest trees, began to fall.",CD

17418,"So, they came to an avenue that was darker than the rest, and were pressing",CD

17419,forward on their journey without looking down it when the lady stopped.,CD

17420,"""My husband,"" said the lady. ""I am called.""",CD

17421,"They listened, and they heard a voice a long way down the avenue, say,",CD

17422,"""Mother, mother!""",CD

17423,"It was the voice of the first child who had said, ""I am going to Heaven!""",CD

17424,"and the father said, ""I pray not yet. The sunset is very near. I pray not yet!""",CD

17425,"But, the voice cried, ""Mother, mother!"" without minding him, though his",CD

17426,"hair was now quite white, and tears were on his face.",CD

17427,"Then, the mother, who was already drawn into the shade of the dark",CD

17428,"avenue and moving away with her arms still round his neck, kissed him, and",CD

17429,"said, ""My dearest, I am summoned, and I go!"" And she was gone. And the",CD

17430,traveller and he were left alone together.,CD

17431,"And they went on and on together, until they came to very near the end of",CD

17432,"the wood: so near, that they could see the sunset shining red before them",CD

17433,through the trees.,CD

17434,"Yet, once more, while he broke his way among the branches, the traveller",CD

17435,"lost his friend. He called and called, but there was no reply, and when he",CD

17436,"passed out of the wood, and saw the peaceful sun going down upon a wide",CD

17437,"purple prospect, he came to an old man sitting on a fallen tree. So, he said to",CD

17438,"the old man, ""What do you do here?"" And the old man said with a calm smile,",CD

17439,"""I am always remembering. Come and remember with me!""",CD

17440,"So the traveller sat down by the side of that old man, face to face with the",CD

17441,serene sunset; and all his friends came softly back and stood around him. The,CD

17442,"beautiful child, the handsome boy, the young man in love, the father, mother,",CD

17443,"and children: every one of them was there, and he had lost nothing. So, he",CD

17444,"loved them all, and was kind and forbearing with them all, and was always",CD

17445,"pleased to watch them all, and they all honoured and loved him. And I think",CD

17446,"the traveller must be yourself, dear Grandfather, because this what you do to",CD

17447,"us, and what we do to you.",CD

17448,The Schoolboy's Story,CD

17449,"Being rather young at present--I am getting on in years, but still I am rather",CD

17450,young--I have no particular adventures of my own to fall back upon. It,CD

17451,"wouldn't much interest anybody here, I suppose, to know what a screw the",CD

17452,"Reverend is, or what a griffin SHE is, or how they do stick it into parents--",CD

17453,"particularly hair-cutting, and medical attendance. One of our fellows was",CD

17454,charged in his half's account twelve and sixpence for two pills--tolerably,CD

17455,"profitable at six and threepence a-piece, I should think--and he never took",CD

17456,"them either, but put them up the sleeve of his jacket.",CD

17457,"As to the beef, it's shameful. It's NOT beef. Regular beef isn't veins. You",CD

17458,"can chew regular beef. Besides which, there's gravy to regular beef, and you",CD

17459,"never see a drop to ours. Another of our fellows went home ill, and heard the",CD

17460,family doctor tell his father that he couldn't account for his complaint unless it,CD

17461,"was the beer. Of course it was the beer, and well it might be!",CD

17462,"However, beef and Old Cheeseman are two different things. So is beer. It",CD

17463,was Old Cheeseman I meant to tell about; not the manner in which our fellows,CD

17464,get their constitutions destroyed for the sake of profit.,CD

17465,"Why, look at the pie-crust alone. There's no flakiness in it. It's solid--like",CD

17466,"damp lead. Then our fellows get nightmares, and are bolstered for calling out",CD

17467,and waking other fellows. Who can wonder!,CD

17468,"Old Cheeseman one night walked in his sleep, put his hat on over his",CD

17469,"night-cap, got hold of a fishing-rod and a cricket-bat, and went down into the",CD

17470,"parlour, where they naturally thought from his appearance he was a Ghost.",CD

17471,"Why, he never would have done that if his meals had been wholesome. When",CD

17472,"we all begin to walk in our sleeps, I suppose they'll be sorry for it.",CD

17473,Old Cheeseman wasn't second Latin Master then; he was a fellow himself.,CD

17474,"He was first brought there, very small, in a post-chaise, by a woman who was",CD

17475,always taking snuff and shaking him--and that was the most he remembered,CD

17476,about it. He never went home for the holidays. His accounts (he never learnt,CD

17477,"any extras) were sent to a Bank, and the Bank paid them; and he had a brown",CD

17478,"suit twice a-year, and went into boots at twelve. They were always too big for",CD

17479,"him, too.",CD

17480,"In the Midsummer holidays, some of our fellows who lived within walking",CD

17481,"distance, used to come back and climb the trees outside the playground wall,",CD

17482,on purpose to look at Old Cheeseman reading there by himself. He was always,CD

17483,"as mild as the tea--and THAT'S pretty mild, I should hope!--so when they",CD

17484,"whistled to him, he looked up and nodded; and when they said, ""Halloa, Old",CD

17485,"Cheeseman, what have you had for dinner?"" he said, ""Boiled mutton;"" and",CD

17486,"when they said, ""An't it solitary, Old Cheeseman?"" he said, ""It is a little dull",CD

17487,"sometimes:"" and then they said, ""Well good-bye, Old Cheeseman!"" and",CD

17488,climbed down again. Of course it was imposing on Old Cheeseman to give,CD

17489,"him nothing but boiled mutton through a whole Vacation, but that was just like",CD

17490,"the system. When they didn't give him boiled mutton, they gave him rice",CD

17491,"pudding, pretending it was a treat. And saved the butcher.",CD

17492,So Old Cheeseman went on. The holidays brought him into other trouble,CD

17493,"besides the loneliness; because when the fellows began to come back, not",CD

17494,"wanting to, he was always glad to see them; which was aggravating when they",CD

17495,"were not at all glad to see him, and so he got his head knocked against walls,",CD

17496,and that was the way his nose bled. But he was a favourite in general. Once a,CD

17497,"subscription was raised for him; and, to keep up his spirits, he was presented",CD

17498,"before the holidays with two white mice, a rabbit, a pigeon, and a beautiful",CD

17499,"puppy. Old Cheeseman cried about it--especially soon afterwards, when they",CD

17500,all ate one another.,CD

17501,Of course Old Cheeseman used to be called by the names of all sorts of,CD

17502,"cheeses--Double Glo'sterman, Family Cheshireman, Dutchman, North",CD

17503,"Wiltshireman, and all that. But he never minded it. And I don't mean to say he",CD

17504,"was old in point of years--because he wasn't--only he was called from the first,",CD

17505,Old Cheeseman.,CD

17506,"At last, Old Cheeseman was made second Latin Master. He was brought in",CD

17507,"one morning at the beginning of a new half, and presented to the school in that",CD

17508,"capacity as ""Mr. Cheeseman."" Then our fellows all agreed that Old Cheeseman",CD

17509,"was a spy, and a deserter, who had gone over to the enemy's camp, and sold",CD

17510,himself for gold. It was no excuse for him that he had sold himself for very,CD

17511,"little gold--two pound ten a quarter and his washing, as was reported. It was",CD

17512,"decided by a Parliament which sat about it, that Old Cheeseman's mercenary",CD

17513,"motives could alone be taken into account, and that he had ""coined our blood",CD

17514,"for drachmas."" The Parliament took the expression out of the quarrel scene",CD

17515,between Brutus and Cassius.,CD

17516,When it was settled in this strong way that Old Cheeseman was a,CD

17517,"tremendous traitor, who had wormed himself into our fellows' secrets on",CD

17518,"purpose to get himself into favour by giving up everything he knew, all",CD

17519,courageous fellows were invited to come forward and enrol themselves in a,CD

17520,Society for making a set against him. The President of the Society was First,CD

17521,"boy, named Bob Tarter. His father was in the West Indies, and he owned,",CD

17522,"himself, that his father was worth Millions. He had great power among our",CD

17523,"fellows, and he wrote a parody, beginning ""Who made believe to be so meek",CD

17524,"That we could hardly hear him speak,",CD

17525,Yet turned out an Informing Sneak?,CD

17526,"Old Cheeseman.""",CD

17527,"- and on in that way through more than a dozen verses, which he used to go",CD

17528,"and sing, every morning, close by the new master's desk. He trained one of the",CD

17529,"low boys, too, a rosy-cheeked little Brass who didn't care what he did, to go up",CD

17530,"to him with his Latin Grammar one morning, and say it so: NOMINATIVUS",CD

17531,"PRONOMINUM--Old Cheeseman, RARO EXPRIMITUR--was never",CD

17532,"suspected, NISI DISTINCTIONIS--of being an informer, AUT EMPHASIS",CD

17533,"GRATiA--until he proved one. UT--for instance, VOS DAMNASTIS--when",CD

17534,"he sold the boys. QUASI--as though, DICAT--he should say, PRETAEREA",CD

17535,NEMO--I'm a Judas! All this produced a great effect on Old Cheeseman. He,CD

17536,"had never had much hair; but what he had, began to get thinner and thinner",CD

17537,every day. He grew paler and more worn; and sometimes of an evening he was,CD

17538,"seen sitting at his desk with a precious long snuff to his candle, and his hands",CD

17539,"before his face, crying. But no member of the Society could pity him, even if",CD

17540,"he felt inclined, because the President said it was Old Cheeseman's",CD

17541,conscience.,CD

17542,"So Old Cheeseman went on, and didn't he lead a miserable life! Of course",CD

17543,"the Reverend turned up his nose at him, and of course SHE did--because both",CD

17544,of them always do that at all the masters--but he suffered from the fellows,CD

17545,"most, and he suffered from them constantly. He never told about it, that the",CD

17546,"Society could find out; but he got no credit for that, because the President said",CD

17547,it was Old Cheeseman's cowardice.,CD

17548,"He had only one friend in the world, and that one was almost as powerless",CD

17549,"as he was, for it was only Jane. Jane was a sort of wardrobe woman to our",CD

17550,"fellows, and took care of the boxes. She had come at first, I believe, as a kind",CD

17551,"of apprentice--some of our fellows say from a Charity, but I don't know--and",CD

17552,"after her time was out, had stopped at so much a year. So little a year, perhaps",CD

17553,"I ought to say, for it is far more likely. However, she had put some pounds in",CD

17554,"the Savings' Bank, and she was a very nice young woman. She was not quite",CD

17555,"pretty; but she had a very frank, honest, bright face, and all our fellows were",CD

17556,"fond of her. She was uncommonly neat and cheerful, and uncommonly",CD

17557,"comfortable and kind. And if anything was the matter with a fellow's mother,",CD

17558,he always went and showed the letter to Jane.,CD

17559,"Jane was Old Cheeseman's friend. The more the Society went against him,",CD

17560,the more Jane stood by him. She used to give him a good- humoured look out,CD

17561,"of her still-room window, sometimes, that seemed to set him up for the day.",CD

17562,She used to pass out of the orchard and the kitchen garden (always kept,CD

17563,"locked, I believe you!) through the playground, when she might have gone the",CD

17564,"other way, only to give a turn of her head, as much as to say ""Keep up your",CD

17565,"spirits!"" to Old Cheeseman. His slip of a room was so fresh and orderly that it",CD

17566,was well known who looked after it while he was at his desk; and when our,CD

17567,"fellows saw a smoking hot dumpling on his plate at dinner, they knew with",CD

17568,indignation who had sent it up.,CD

17569,"Under these circumstances, the Society resolved, after a quantity of",CD

17570,"meeting and debating, that Jane should be requested to cut Old Cheeseman",CD

17571,"dead; and that if she refused, she must be sent to Coventry herself. So a",CD

17572,"deputation, headed by the President, was appointed to wait on Jane, and",CD

17573,inform her of the vote the Society had been under the painful necessity of,CD

17574,"passing. She was very much respected for all her good qualities, and there was",CD

17575,"a story about her having once waylaid the Reverend in his own study, and got",CD

17576,"a fellow off from severe punishment, of her own kind comfortable heart. So",CD

17577,"the deputation didn't much like the job. However, they went up, and the",CD

17578,"President told Jane all about it. Upon which Jane turned very red, burst into",CD

17579,"tears, informed the President and the deputation, in a way not at all like her",CD

17580,"usual way, that they were a parcel of malicious young savages, and turned the",CD

17581,whole respected body out of the room. Consequently it was entered in the,CD

17582,"Society's book (kept in astronomical cypher for fear of detection), that all",CD

17583,communication with Jane was interdicted: and the President addressed the,CD

17584,members on this convincing instance of Old Cheeseman's undermining.,CD

17585,But Jane was as true to Old Cheeseman as Old Cheeseman was false to our,CD

17586,"fellows--in their opinion, at all events--and steadily continued to be his only",CD

17587,"friend. It was a great exasperation to the Society, because Jane was as much a",CD

17588,loss to them as she was a gain to him; and being more inveterate against him,CD

17589,"than ever, they treated him worse than ever. At last, one morning, his desk",CD

17590,"stood empty, his room was peeped into, and found to be vacant, and a whisper",CD

17591,"went about among the pale faces of our fellows that Old Cheeseman, unable to",CD

17592,"bear it any longer, had got up early and drowned himself.",CD

17593,"The mysterious looks of the other masters after breakfast, and the evident",CD

17594,"fact that old Cheeseman was not expected, confirmed the Society in this",CD

17595,opinion. Some began to discuss whether the President was liable to hanging or,CD

17596,"only transportation for life, and the President's face showed a great anxiety to",CD

17597,"know which. However, he said that a jury of his country should find him",CD

17598,game; and that in his address he should put it to them to lay their hands upon,CD

17599,"their hearts and say whether they as Britons approved of informers, and how",CD

17600,they thought they would like it themselves. Some of the Society considered,CD

17601,that he had better run away until he found a forest where he might change,CD

17602,"clothes with a wood-cutter, and stain his face with blackberries; but the",CD

17603,"majority believed that if he stood his ground, his father--belonging as he did to",CD

17604,"the West Indies, and being worth millions--could buy him off.",CD

17605,"All our fellows' hearts beat fast when the Reverend came in, and made a",CD

17606,"sort of a Roman, or a Field Marshal, of himself with the ruler; as he always did",CD

17607,before delivering an address. But their fears were nothing to their,CD

17608,"astonishment when he came out with the story that Old Cheeseman, ""so long",CD

17609,"our respected friend and fellow- pilgrim in the pleasant plains of knowledge,""",CD

17610,he called him--O yes! I dare say! Much of that!--was the orphan child of a,CD

17611,"disinherited young lady who had married against her father's wish, and whose",CD

17612,"young husband had died, and who had died of sorrow herself, and whose",CD

17613,unfortunate baby (Old Cheeseman) had been brought up at the cost of a,CD

17614,"grandfather who would never consent to see it, baby, boy, or man: which",CD

17615,"grandfather was now dead, and serve him right--that's my putting in--and",CD

17616,"which grandfather's large property, there being no will, was now, and all of a",CD

17617,"sudden and for ever, Old Cheeseman's! Our so long respected friend and",CD

17618,"fellow-pilgrim in the pleasant plains of knowledge, the Reverend wound up a",CD

17619,"lot of bothering quotations by saying, would ""come among us once more"" that",CD

17620,"day fortnight, when he desired to take leave of us himself, in a more particular",CD

17621,"manner. With these words, he stared severely round at our fellows, and went",CD

17622,solemnly out.,CD

17623,"There was precious consternation among the members of the Society, now.",CD

17624,"Lots of them wanted to resign, and lots more began to try to make out that",CD

17625,"they had never belonged to it. However, the President stuck up, and said that",CD

17626,"they must stand or fall together, and that if a breach was made it should be",CD

17627,over his body--which was meant to encourage the Society: but it didn't. The,CD

17628,"President further said, he would consider the position in which they stood, and",CD

17629,would give them his best opinion and advice in a few days. This was eagerly,CD

17630,"looked for, as he knew a good deal of the world on account of his father's",CD

17631,being in the West Indies.,CD

17632,"After days and days of hard thinking, and drawing armies all over his slate,",CD

17633,"the President called our fellows together, and made the matter clear. He said it",CD

17634,"was plain that when Old Cheeseman came on the appointed day, his first",CD

17635,"revenge would be to impeach the Society, and have it flogged all round. After",CD

17636,"witnessing with joy the torture of his enemies, and gloating over the cries",CD

17637,"which agony would extort from them, the probability was that he would invite",CD

17638,"the Reverend, on pretence of conversation, into a private room--say the",CD

17639,"parlour into which Parents were shown, where the two great globes were",CD

17640,which were never used--and would there reproach him with the various frauds,CD

17641,and oppressions he had endured at his hands. At the close of his observations,CD

17642,"he would make a signal to a Prizefighter concealed in the passage, who would",CD

17643,"then appear and pitch into the Reverend, till he was left insensible. Old",CD

17644,"Cheeseman would then make Jane a present of from five to ten pounds, and",CD

17645,would leave the establishment in fiendish triumph.,CD

17646,"The President explained that against the parlour part, or the Jane part, of",CD

17647,"these arrangements he had nothing to say; but, on the part of the Society, he",CD

17648,counselled deadly resistance. With this view he recommended that all,CD

17649,"available desks should be filled with stones, and that the first word of the",CD

17650,complaint should be the signal to every fellow to let fly at Old Cheeseman.,CD

17651,"The bold advice put the Society in better spirits, and was unanimously taken.",CD

17652,"A post about Old Cheeseman's size was put up in the playground, and all our",CD

17653,fellows practised at it till it was dinted all over.,CD

17654,"When the day came, and Places were called, every fellow sat down in a",CD

17655,tremble. There had been much discussing and disputing as to how Old,CD

17656,Cheeseman would come; but it was the general opinion that he would appear,CD

17657,"in a sort of triumphal car drawn by four horses, with two livery servants in",CD

17658,"front, and the Prizefighter in disguise up behind. So, all our fellows sat",CD

17659,"listening for the sound of wheels. But no wheels were heard, for Old",CD

17660,"Cheeseman walked after all, and came into the school without any preparation.",CD

17661,"Pretty much as he used to be, only dressed in black.",CD

17662,"""Gentlemen,"" said the Reverend, presenting him, ""our so long respected",CD

17663,"friend and fellow-pilgrim in the pleasant plains of knowledge, is desirous to",CD

17664,"offer a word or two. Attention, gentlemen, one and all!""",CD

17665,Every fellow stole his hand into his desk and looked at the President. The,CD

17666,"President was all ready, and taking aim at old Cheeseman with his eyes.",CD

17667,"What did Old Cheeseman then, but walk up to his old desk, look round",CD

17668,"him with a queer smile as if there was a tear in his eye, and begin in a",CD

17669,"quavering, mild voice, ""My dear companions and old friends!""",CD

17670,"Every fellow's hand came out of his desk, and the President suddenly",CD

17671,began to cry.,CD

17672,"""My dear companions and old friends,"" said Old Cheeseman, ""you have",CD

17673,heard of my good fortune. I have passed so many years under this roof--my,CD

17674,"entire life so far, I may say--that I hope you have been glad to hear of it for my",CD

17675,sake. I could never enjoy it without exchanging congratulations with you. If,CD

17676,"we have ever misunderstood one another at all, pray, my dear boys, let us",CD

17677,"forgive and forget. I have a great tenderness for you, and I am sure you return",CD

17678,it. I want in the fulness of a grateful heart to shake hands with you every one. I,CD

17679,"have come back to do it, if you please, my dear boys.""",CD

17680,"Since the President had begun to cry, several other fellows had broken out",CD

17681,"here and there: but now, when Old Cheeseman began with him as first boy,",CD

17682,laid his left hand affectionately on his shoulder and gave him his right; and,CD

17683,"when the President said ""Indeed, I don't deserve it, sir; upon my honour I",CD

17684,"don't;"" there was sobbing and crying all over the school. Every other fellow",CD

17685,"said he didn't deserve it, much in the same way; but Old Cheeseman, not",CD

17686,"minding that a bit, went cheerfully round to every boy, and wound up with",CD

17687,every master--finishing off the Reverend last.,CD

17688,"Then a snivelling little chap in a corner, who was always under some",CD

17689,"punishment or other, set up a shrill cry of ""Success to Old Cheeseman!",CD

17690,"Hooray!"" The Reverend glared upon him, and said, ""MR. Cheeseman, sir.""",CD

17691,"But, Old Cheeseman protesting that he liked his old name a great deal better",CD

17692,"than his new one, all our fellows took up the cry; and, for I don't know how",CD

17693,"many minutes, there was such a thundering of feet and hands, and such a",CD

17694,"roaring of Old Cheeseman, as never was heard.",CD

17695,"After that, there was a spread in the dining-room of the most magnificent",CD

17696,"kind. Fowls, tongues, preserves, fruits, confectionaries, jellies, neguses,",CD

17697,"barley-sugar temples, trifles, crackers--eat all you can and pocket what you",CD

17698,"like--all at Old Cheeseman's expense. After that, speeches, whole holiday,",CD

17699,"double and treble sets of all manners of things for all manners of games,",CD

17700,"donkeys, pony-chaises and drive yourself, dinner for all the masters at the",CD

17701,"Seven Bells (twenty pounds a-head our fellows estimated it at), an annual",CD

17702,"holiday and feast fixed for that day every year, and another on Old",CD

17703,"Cheeseman's birthday--Reverend bound down before the fellows to allow it,",CD

17704,so that he could never back out--all at Old Cheeseman's expense.,CD

17705,And didn't our fellows go down in a body and cheer outside the Seven,CD

17706,Bells? O no!,CD

17707,"But there's something else besides. Don't look at the next story- teller, for",CD

17708,"there's more yet. Next day, it was resolved that the Society should make it up",CD

17709,"with Jane, and then be dissolved. What do you think of Jane being gone,",CD

17710,"though! ""What? Gone for ever?"" said our fellows, with long faces. ""Yes, to be",CD

17711,"sure,"" was all the answer they could get. None of the people about the house",CD

17712,"would say anything more. At length, the first boy took upon himself to ask the",CD

17713,Reverend whether our old friend Jane was really gone? The Reverend (he has,CD

17714,"got a daughter at home--turn-up nose, and red) replied severely, ""Yes, sir, Miss",CD

17715,"Pitt is gone."" The idea of calling Jane, Miss Pitt! Some said she had been sent",CD

17716,away in disgrace for taking money from Old Cheeseman; others said she had,CD

17717,gone into Old Cheeseman's service at a rise of ten pounds a year. All that our,CD

17718,"fellows knew, was, she was gone.",CD

17719,"It was two or three months afterwards, when, one afternoon, an open",CD

17720,"carriage stopped at the cricket field, just outside bounds, with a lady and",CD

17721,"gentleman in it, who looked at the game a long time and stood up to see it",CD

17722,"played. Nobody thought much about them, until the same little snivelling chap",CD

17723,"came in, against all rules, from the post where he was Scout, and said, ""It's",CD

17724,"Jane!"" Both Elevens forgot the game directly, and ran crowding round the",CD

17725,"carriage. It WAS Jane! In such a bonnet! And if you'll believe me, Jane was",CD

17726,married to Old Cheeseman.,CD

17727,It soon became quite a regular thing when our fellows were hard at it in the,CD

17728,"playground, to see a carriage at the low part of the wall where it joins the high",CD

17729,"part, and a lady and gentleman standing up in it, looking over. The gentleman",CD

17730,"was always Old Cheeseman, and the lady was always Jane.",CD

17731,"The first time I ever saw them, I saw them in that way. There had been a",CD

17732,"good many changes among our fellows then, and it had turned out that Bob",CD

17733,Tarter's father wasn't worth Millions! He wasn't worth anything. Bob had gone,CD

17735,"the carriage. The carriage stopped, and all our fellows stopped as soon as it",CD

17736,was seen.,CD

17737,"""So you have never sent me to Coventry after all!"" said the lady, laughing,",CD

17738,"as our fellows swarmed up the wall to shake hands with her. ""Are you never",CD

17739,"going to do it?""",CD

17740,"""Never! never! never!"" on all sides.",CD

17741,"I didn't understand what she meant then, but of course I do now. I was very",CD

17742,"much pleased with her face though, and with her good way, and I couldn't help",CD

17743,looking at her--and at him too--with all our fellows clustering so joyfully,CD

17744,about them.,CD

17745,"They soon took notice of me as a new boy, so I thought I might as well",CD

17746,"swarm up the wall myself, and shake hands with them as the rest did. I was",CD

17747,"quite as glad to see them as the rest were, and was quite as familiar with them",CD

17748,in a moment.,CD

17749,"""Only a fortnight now,"" said Old Cheeseman, ""to the holidays. Who stops?",CD

17750,"Anybody?""",CD

17751,"A good many fingers pointed at me, and a good many voices cried ""He",CD

17752,"does!"" For it was the year when you were all away; and rather low I was about",CD

17753,"it, I can tell you.",CD

17754,"""Oh!"" said Old Cheeseman. ""But it's solitary here in the holiday time. He",CD

17755,"had better come to us.""",CD

17856,him beyond all apprehension from his old life. The horrid tragedy in which he,OH

17857,"had played such a disastrous part now began, for the first time since he stole",OH

17858,"on board the fruiter, a wretched fugitive, to lose its sharper outlines. Distance",OH

17859,lent assuagement to his view. Bibb had opened the flood-gates of a stream of,OH

17860,"long-dammed discourse, overjoyed to have captured an audience that had not",OH

17861,suffered under a hundred repetitions of his views and theories.,OH

17862,"""One year more,"" said Bibb, ""and I'll go back to God's country. Oh, I know it's",OH

17863,"pretty here, and you get dolce far niente handed to you in chunks, but this",OH

17864,country wasn't made for a white man to live in. You've got to have to plug,OH

17865,"through snow now and then, and see a game of baseball and wear a stiff collar",OH

17866,"and have a policeman cuss you. Still, La Paz is a good sort of a pipe-dreamy",OH

17867,old hole. And Mrs. Conant is here. When any of us feels particularly like,OH

17868,jumping into the sea we rush around to her house and propose. It's nicer to be,OH

17869,rejected by Mrs. Conant than it is to be drowned. And they say drowning is a,OH

17870,"delightful sensation.""",OH

17871,"""Many like her here?"" asked Merriam.",OH

17872,"""Not anywhere,"" said Bibb, with a comfortable sigh. She's the only white",OH

17873,woman in La Paz. The rest range from a dappled dun to the colour of a b-flat,OH

17879,"""M�well, she looks it; but her talk's translucent enough. But that's a woman. I",OH

17882,"But you won't think about that when you meet her, Merriam. You'll propose to",OH

17883,"her too.""",OH

17884,"To make a hard story soft, Merriam did meet her and propose to her. He found",OH

17885,"her to be a woman in black with hair the colour of a bronze turkey's wings,",OH

17886,"and mysterious, remembering eyes that�well, that looked as if she might",OH

17887,have been a trained nurse looking on when Eve was created. Her words and,OH

17888,"manner, though, were translucent, as Bibb had said. She spoke, vaguely, of",OH

17889,friends in California and some of the lower parishes in Louisiana. The tropical,OH

17890,climate and indolent life suited her; she had thought of buying an orange grove,OH

17891,"later on; La Paz, all in all, charmed her.",OH

17892,"Merriam's courtship of the Sphinx lasted three months, although be did not",OH

17893,"know that he was courting her. He was using her as an antidote for remorse,",OH

17894,"until he found, too late, that he had acquired the habit. During that time he had",OH

17895,received no news from home. Wade did not know where he was; and he was,OH

17896,"not sure of Wade's exact address, and was afraid to write. He thought he had",OH

17897,better let matters rest as they were for a while.,OH

17898,One afternoon he and Mrs. Conant hired two ponies and rode out along the,OH

17899,mountain trail as far as the little cold river that came tumbling down the,OH

17904,intoxication and back to his senses.,OH

17905,"""I beg your pardon, Florence,"" he said, releasing her hand; ""but I'll have to",OH

17906,"hedge on part of what I said. I can't ask you to marry me, of course. I killed a",OH

17907,man in New York�a man who was my friend�shot him down�in quite a,OH

17908,"cowardly manner, I understand. Of course, the drinking didn't excuse it. Well,",OH

17909,I couldn't resist having my say; and I'll always mean it. I'm here as a fugitive,OH

17910,"from justice, and�I suppose that ends our acquaintance.""",OH

17911,Mrs. Conant plucked little leaves assiduously from the low-hanging branch of,OH

17912,a lime tree.,OH

17913,"""I suppose so,"" she said, in low and oddly uneven tones; ""but that depends",OH

17914,upon you. I'll be as honest as you were. I poisoned my husband. I am a selfmade widow. A man cannot love a murderess. So I suppose that ends our,OH

17915,"acquaintance.""",OH

17916,"She looked up at him slowly. His face turned a little pale, and he stared at her",OH

17917,"blankly, like a deaf-and-dumb man who was wondering what it was all about.",OH

17918,"She took a swift step toward him, with stiffened arms and eyes blazing.",OH

17919,"""Don't look at me like that!"" she cried, as though she were in acute pain.",OH

17920,"""Curse me, or turn your back on me, but don't look that way. Am I a woman to",OH

17921,"be beaten? If I could show you�here on my arms, and on my back are scars�",OH

17922,and it has been more than a year�scars that he made in his brutal rages. A,OH

17923,"holy nun would have risen and struck the fiend down. Yes, I killed him. The",OH

17924,foul and horrible words that he hurled at me that last day are repeated in my,OH

17925,"ears every night when I sleep. And then came his blows, and the end of my",OH

17926,endurance. I got the poison that afternoon. It was his custom to drink every,OH

17927,night in the library before going to bed a hot punch made of rum and wine.,OH

17928,Only from my fair hands would he receive it� because he knew the fumes of,OH

17929,spirits always sickened me. That night when the maid brought it to me I sent,OH

17930,her downstairs on an errand. Before taking him his drink I went to my little,OH

17931,private cabinet and poured into it more than a tea-spoonful of tincture of,OH

17932,"aconite�enough to kill three men, so I had learned. I had drawn $6,000 that I",OH

17933,"had in bank, and with that and a few things in a satchel I left the house without",OH

17934,any one seeing me. As I passed the library I heard him stagger up and fall,OH

17935,"heavily on a couch. I took a night train for New Orleans, and from there I",OH

17936,sailed to the Bermudas. I finally cast anchor in La Paz. And now what have,OH

17937,"you to say? Can you open your mouth?""",OH

17938,Merriam came back to life.,OH

17939,"""Florence,"" he said earnestly, ""I want you. I don't care what you've done. If the",OH

17940,"world�""",OH

17941,"""Ralph,"" she interrupted, almost with a scream, ""be my world!""",OH

17942,Her eyes melted; she relaxed magnificently and swayed toward Merriam so,OH

17943,suddenly that he had to jump to catch her.,OH

17944,Dear me! in such scenes how the talk runs into artificial prose. But it can't be,OH

17945,helped. It's the subconscious smell of the footlights' smoke that's in all of us.,OH

17946,Stir the depths of your cook's soul sufficiently and she will discourse in,OH

17947,Bulwer-Lyttonese.,OH

17948,Merriam and Mrs. Conant were very happy. He announced their engagement,OH

17949,at the Hotel Orilla del Mar. Eight foreigners and four native Astors pounded,OH

17950,"his back and shouted insincere congratulations at him. Pedrito, the Castilianmannered barkeep, was goaded to extra duty until his agility would have",OH

17951,turned a Boston cherry-phosphate clerk a pale lilac with envy.,OH

17952,They were both very happy. According to the strange mathematics of the god,OH

17953,"of mutual affinity, the shadows that clouded their pasts when united became",OH

17954,only half as dense instead of darker. They shut the world out and bolted the,OH

17955,doors. Each was the other's world. Mrs. Conant lived again. The remembering,OH

17956,look left her eyes. Merriam was with her every moment that was possible. On,OH

17957,a little plateau under a grove of palms and calabash trees they were going to,OH

17958,build a fairy bungalow. They were to be married in two months. Many hours,OH

17959,of the day they had their heads together over the house plans. Their joint,OH

17960,capital would set up a business in fruit or woods that would yield a,OH

17961,"comfortable support. ""Good night, my world,"" would say Mrs. Conant every",OH

17962,evening when Merriam left her for his hotel. They were very happy. Their love,OH

17963,"had, circumstantially, that element of melancholy in it that it seems to require",OH

17964,to attain its supremest elevation. And it seemed that their mutual great,OH

17965,misfortune or sin was a bond that nothing could sever.,OH

17966,One day a steamer hove in the offing. Bare-legged and bare-shouldered La Paz,OH

17967,"scampered down to the beach, for the arrival of a steamer was their loop-theloop, circus, Emancipation Day and four-o'clock tea.",OH

17968,"When the steamer was near enough, wise ones proclaimed that she was the",OH

17969,"Pajaro, bound up-coast from Callao to Panama.",OH

17970,The Pajaro put on brakes a mile off shore. Soon a boat came bobbing,OH

17971,shoreward. Merriam strolled down on the beach to look on. In the shallow,OH

17972,water the Carib sailors sprang out and dragged the boat with a mighty rush to,OH

17973,"the firm shingle. Out climbed the purser, the captain and two passengers,",OH

17974,ploughing their way through the deep sand toward the hotel. Merriam glanced,OH

17975,toward them with the mild interest due to strangers. There was something,OH

17976,"familiar to him in the walk of one of the passengers. He looked again, and his",OH

17977,"blood seemed to turn to strawberry ice cream in his veins. Burly, arrogant,",OH

17978,"debonair as ever, H. Ferguson Hedges, the man he had killed, was coming",OH

17979,toward him ten feet away.,OH

17980,When Hedges saw Merriam his face flushed a dark red. Then he shouted in his,OH

17981,"old, bluff way: ""Hello, Merriam. Glad to see you. Didn't expect to find you out",OH

17982,"here. Quinby, this is my old friend Merriam, of New York�Merriam, Mr.",OH

17983,"Quinby.""",OH

17984,"Merriam gave Hedges and then Quinby an ice-cold hand. ""Br-r-r-r!"" said",OH

17985,"Hedges. ""But you've got a frapp�d flipper! Man, you're not well. You're as",OH

17986,"yellow as a Chinaman. Malarial here? Steer us to a bar if there is such a thing,",OH

17987,"and let's take a prophylactic.""",OH

17988,"Merriam, still half comatose, led them toward the Hotel Orilla del Mar.",OH

17989,"""Quinby and I,"" explained Hedges, puffing through the slippery sand, ""are",OH

17990,looking out along the coast for some investments. We've just come up from,OH

17991,Concepci�n and Valparaiso and Lima. The captain of this subsidized ferry boat,OH

17992,told us there was some good picking around here in silver mines. So we got,OH

17993,"off. Now, where is that caf�, Merriam? Oh, in this portable soda water",OH

17994,"pavilion?""",OH

17995,"Leaving Quinby at the bar, Hedges drew Merriam aside.",OH

17996,"""Now, what does this mean?"" he said, with gruff kindness. ""Are you sulking",OH

17997,"about that fool row we had?""",OH

17998,"""I thought,"" stammered Merriam�""I heard�they told me you were�that I",OH

17999,"had�""",OH

18000,"""Well, you didn't, and I'm not,"" said Hedges. ""That fool young ambulance",OH

18001,surgeon told Wade I was a candidate for a coffin just because I'd got tired and,OH

18003,"kicking as hard as ever. Wade and I tried to find you, but couldn't. Now,",OH

18004,"Merriam, shake hands and forget it all. I was as much to blame as you were;",OH

18005,and the shot really did me good�I came out of the hospital as healthy and fit,OH

18006,"as a cab horse. Come on; that drink's waiting.""",OH

18007,"""Old man,"" said Merriam, brokenly, ""I don't know how to thank you�I�well,",OH

18008,"you know�""",OH

18009,"""Oh, forget it,"" boomed Hedges. ""Quinby'll die of thirst if we don't join him.""",OH

18010,Bibb was sitting on the shady side of the gallery waiting for the eleven-o'clock,OH

18011,breakfast. Presently Merriam came out and joined him. His eye was strangely,OH

18012,bright.,OH

18013,"""Bibb, my boy,"" said he, slowly waving his hand, ""do you see those mountains",OH

18014,"and that sea and sky and sunshine?�they're mine, Bibbsy�all mine.""",OH

18015,"""You go in,"" said Bibb, ""and take eight grains of quinine, right away. It won't",OH

18017,"O'Neill either.""",OH

18018,"Inside, the purser was untying a great roll of newspapers, many of them weeks",OH

18019,"old, gathered in the lower ports by the Pajaro to be distributed at casual",OH

18020,stopping-places. Thus do the beneficent voyagers scatter news and,OH

18021,entertainment among the prisoners of sea and mountains.,OH

18022,"Tio Pancho, the hotel proprietor, set his great silver-rimmed anteojos upon his",OH

18023,nose and divided the papers into a number of smaller rolls. A barefooted,OH

18024,"muchacho dashed in, desiring the post of messenger.",OH

18025,"""Bien venido,"" said Tio Pancho. ""This to Se�ora Conant; that to el Doctor S-SSchlegel�Dios! what a name to say!�that to Se�or Davis�one for Don",OH

18030,Mrs. Conant received her roll of newspapers at four o'clock. The boy was late,OH

18031,"in delivering them, because he had been deflected from his duty by an iguana",OH

18032,that crossed his path and to which he immediately gave chase. But it made no,OH

18033,"hardship, for she had no letters to send.",OH

18034,"She was idling in a hammock in the patio of the house that she occupied, half",OH

18035,"awake, half happily dreaming of the paradise that she and Merriam had",OH

18036,created out of the wrecks of their pasts. She was content now for the horizon,OH

18037,of that shimmering sea to be the horizon of her life. They had shut out the,OH

18038,world and closed the door.,OH

18039,"Merriam was coming to her house at seven, after his dinner at the hotel. She",OH

18040,"would put on a white dress and an apricot-coloured lace mantilla, and they",OH

18041,would walk an hour under the cocoanut palms by the lagoon. She smiled,OH

18042,"contentedly, and chose a paper at random from the roll the boy had brought.",OH

18043,At first the words of a certain headline of a Sunday newspaper meant nothing,OH

18053,much unhappiness. Stories were not wanting to the effect that his cruelty,OH

18055,"her departure a full bottle of tincture of aconite, a deadly poison, was found in",OH

18056,a small medicine cabinet in her bedroom. This might have been an indication,OH

18073,"still for ten minutes, looking into space. She looked into space through a",OH

18074,slowly opening door. On her side of the door was the building material for a,OH

18075,"castle of Romance�love, an Arcady of waving palms, a lullaby of waves on",OH

18076,"the shore of a haven of rest, respite, peace, a lotus land of dreamy ease and",OH

18079,"that is, you will not? Very well; then listen.",OH

18080,She saw herself go into a department store and buy five spools of silk thread,OH

18084,"Conant?"" she said. At the corner a policeman helped her across the street and",OH

18122,shoes into the trunk with her other.,OH

18123,At six o'clock Mateo returned and reported the sloop ready. He and his brother,OH

18124,"lifted the trunk into the cart, covered it with straw and conveyed it to the point",OH

18125,of embarkation. From there they transferred it on board in the sloop's dory.,OH

18126,Then Mateo returned for additional orders.,OH

18127,"Mrs. Conant was ready. She had settled all business matters with Angela, and",OH

18128,"was impatiently waiting. She wore a long, loose black-silk duster that she",OH

18129,often walked about in when the evenings were chilly. On her head was a small,OH

18130,"round hat, and over it the apricot-coloured lace mantilla.",OH

18131,Dusk had quickly followed the short twilight. Mateo led her by dark and grassgrown streets toward the point behind which the sloop was anchored. On,OH

18132,"turning a corner they beheld the Hotel Orilla del Mar three streets away,",OH

18133,nebulously aglow with its array of kerosene lamps.,OH

18134,"Mrs. Conant paused, with streaming eyes. ""I must, I must see him once before",OH

18135,"I go,"" she murmured in anguish. But even then she did not falter in her",OH

18136,"decision. Quickly she invented a plan by which she might speak to him, and",OH

18137,"yet make her departure without his knowing. She would walk past the hotel,",OH

18138,"ask some one to call him out and talk a few moments on some trivial excuse,",OH

18139,leaving him expecting to see her at her home at seven.,OH

18140,"She unpinned her hat and gave it to Mateo. ""Keep this, and wait here till I",OH

18141,"come,"" she ordered. Then she draped the mantilla over her head as she usually",OH

18142,"did when walking after sunset, and went straight to the Orilla del Mar.",OH

18143,"She was glad to see the bulky, white-clad figure of Tio Pancho standing alone",OH

18144,on the gallery.,OH

18146,"Merriam to come out for just a few moments that I may speak with him?""",OH

18147,Tio Pancho bowed as an elephant bows.,OH

18148,"""Buenas tardes, Se�ora Conant,"" he said, as a cavalier talks. And then he went",OH

18153,THE THEORY AND THE HOUND,OH

18154,"Not many days ago my old friend from the tropics, J. P. Bridger, United States",OH

18155,"consul on the island of Ratona, was in the city. We had wassail and jubilee and",OH

18156,"saw the Flatiron building, and missed seeing the Bronxless menagerie by",OH

18157,"about a couple of nights. And then, at the ebb tide, we were walking up a",OH

18158,street that parallels and parodies Broadway.,OH

18159,"A woman with a comely and mundane countenance passed us, holding in leash",OH

18160,"a wheezing, vicious, waddling, brute of a yellow pug. The dog entangled",OH

18161,"himself with Bridger's legs and mumbled his ankles in a snarling, peevish,",OH

18162,"sulky bite. Bridger, with a happy smile, kicked the breath out of the brute; the",OH

18163,woman showered us with a quick rain of well-conceived adjectives that left us,OH

18164,"in no doubt as to our place in her opinion, and we passed on. Ten yards farther",OH

18165,an old woman with disordered white hair and her bankbook tucked well,OH

18166,hidden beneath her tattered shawl begged. Bridger stopped and disinterred for,OH

18167,her a quarter from his holiday waistcoat.,OH

18168,"On the next corner a quarter of a ton of well-clothed man with a ricepowdered, fat, white jowl, stood holding the chain of a devil-born bulldog",OH

18169,whose forelegs were strangers by the length of a dachshund. A little woman in,OH

18170,"a last-season's hat confronted him and wept, which was plainly all she could",OH

18171,"do, while he cursed her in low sweet, practised tones.",OH

18172,Bridger smiled again�strictly to himself�and this time he took out a little,OH

18173,memorandum book and made a note of it. This he had no right to do without,OH

18174,"due explanation, and I said so.",OH

18175,"""It's a new theory,"" said Bridger, ""that I picked up down in Ratona. I've been",OH

18176,"gathering support for it as I knock about. The world isn't ripe for it yet, but�",OH

18177,well I'll tell you; and then you run your mind back along the people you've,OH

18178,"known and see what you make of it.""",OH

18179,And so I cornered Bridger in a place where they have artificial palms and,OH

18180,wine; and he told me the story which is here in my words and on his,OH

18181,responsibility.,OH

18182,"One afternoon at three o'clock, on the island of Ratona, a boy raced along the",OH

18183,"beach screaming, ""Pajaro, ahoy!""",OH

18184,Thus he made known the keenness of his hearing and the justice of his,OH

18185,discrimination in pitch.,OH

18186,He who first heard and made oral proclamation concerning the toot of an,OH

18187,"approaching steamer's whistle, and correctly named the steamer, was a small",OH

18188,"hero in Ratona�until the next steamer came. Wherefore, there was rivalry",OH

18189,"among the barefoot youth of Ratona, and many fell victims to the softly blown",OH

18190,"conch shells of sloops which, as they enter harbour, sound surprisingly like a",OH

18191,"distant steamer's signal. And some could name you the vessel when its call, in",OH

18192,"your duller ears, sounded no louder than the sigh of the wind through the",OH

18193,branches of the cocoanut palms.,OH

18194,But to-day he who proclaimed the Pajaro gained his honours. Ratona bent its,OH

18195,"ear to listen; and soon the deep-tongued blast grew louder and nearer, and at",OH

18196,"length Ratona saw above the line of palms on the low ""point"" the two black",OH

18197,funnels of the fruiter slowly creeping toward the mouth of the harbour.,OH

18198,You must know that Ratona is an island twenty miles off the south of a South,OH

18199,American republic. It is a port of that republic; and it sleeps sweetly in a,OH

18200,"smiling sea, toiling not nor spinning; fed by the abundant tropics where all",OH

18201,"things ""ripen, cease and fall toward the grave.""",OH

18202,Eight hundred people dream life away in a green-embowered village that,OH

18203,follows the horseshoe curve of its bijou harbour. They are mostly Spanish and,OH

18204,"Indian mestizos, with a shading of San Domingo Negroes, a lightening of",OH

18205,pure-blood Spanish officials and a slight leavening of the froth of three or four,OH

18206,pioneering white races. No steamers touch at Ratona save the fruit steamers,OH

18207,which take on their banana inspectors there on their way to the coast. They,OH

18208,"leave Sunday newspapers, ice, quinine, bacon, watermelons and vaccine",OH

18209,matter at the island and that is about all the touch Ratona gets with the world.,OH

18210,"The Pajaro paused at the mouth of the harbour, rolling heavily in the swell that",OH

18211,sent the whitecaps racing beyond the smooth water inside. Already two dories,OH

18212,"from the village�one conveying fruit inspectors, the other going for what it",OH

18213,could get�were halfway out to the steamer.,OH

18214,"The inspectors' dory was taken on board with them, and the Pajaro steamed",OH

18215,away for the mainland for its load of fruit.,OH

18218,"sheriff of Chatham County, Kentucky.",OH

18219,"Bridger, the United States consul at Ratona, was cleaning his rifle in the",OH

18220,official shanty under a bread-fruit tree twenty yards from the water of the,OH

18221,harbour. The consul occupied a place somewhat near the tail of his political,OH

18222,party's procession. The music of the band wagon sounded very faintly to him,OH

18223,in the distance. The plums of office went to others. Bridger's share of the,OH

18224,spoils�the consulship at Ratona�was little more than a prune�a dried prune,OH

18225,from the boarding-house department of the public crib. But $900 yearly was,OH

18226,"opulence in Ratona. Besides, Bridger had contracted a passion for shooting",OH

18227,"alligators in the lagoons near his consulate, and was not unhappy.",OH

18228,He looked up from a careful inspection of his rifle lock and saw a broad man,OH

18229,"filling his doorway. A broad, noiseless, slow-moving man, sunburned almost",OH

18230,"to the brown of Vandyke. A man of forty-five, neatly clothed in homespun,",OH

18231,"with scanty light hair, a close-clipped brown-and-gray beard and pale-blue",OH

18232,eyes expressing mildness and simplicity.,OH

18233,"""You are Mr. Bridger, the consul,"" said the broad man. ""They directed me",OH

18234,here. Can you tell me what those big bunches of things like gourds are in those,OH

18235,"trees that look like feather dusters along the edge of the water?""",OH

18236,"""Take that chair,"" said the consul, reoiling his cleaning rag. ""No, the other one",OH

18237,"�that bamboo thing won't hold you. Why, they're cocoanuts�green",OH

18238,"cocoanuts. The shell of 'em is always a light green before they're ripe.""",OH

18239,"""Much obliged,"" said the other man, sitting down carefully. ""I didn't quite like",OH

18240,to tell the folks at home they were olives unless I was sure about it. My name,OH

18241,"is Plunkett. I'm sheriff of Chatham County, Kentucky. I've got extradition",OH

18242,papers in my pocket authorizing the arrest of a man on this island. They've,OH

18243,"been signed by the President of this country, and they're in correct shape. The",OH

18244,man's name is Wade Williams. He's in the cocoanut raising business. What,OH

18245,he's wanted for is the murder of his wife two years ago. Where can I find,OH

18246,"him?""",OH

18247,The consul squinted an eye and looked through his rifle barrel.,OH

18248,"""There's nobody on the island who calls himself 'Williams,'"" he remarked.",OH

18249,"""Didn't suppose there was,"" said Plunkett mildly. ""He'll do by any other",OH

18250,"name.""",OH

18251,"""Besides myself,"" said Bridger, ""there are only two Americans on Ratona�",OH

18252,"Bob Reeves and Henry Morgan.""",OH

18253,"""The man I want sells cocoanuts,"" suggested Plunkett.",OH

18254,"""You see that cocoanut walk extending up to the point?"" said the consul,",OH

18255,"waving his hand toward the open door. ""That belongs to Bob Reeves. Henry",OH

18256,"Morgan owns half the trees to loo'ard on the island.""",OH

18257,"""One, month ago,"" said the sheriff, ""Wade Williams wrote a confidential letter",OH

18258,"to a man in Chatham county, telling him where he was and how he was getting",OH

18259,along. The letter was lost; and the person that found it gave it away. They sent,OH

18260,"me after him, and I've got the papers. I reckon he's one of your cocoanut men",OH

18261,"for certain.""",OH

18262,"""You've got his picture, of course,"" said Bridger. ""It might be Reeves or",OH

18263,"Morgan, but I'd hate to think it. They're both as fine fellows as you'd meet in",OH

18264,"an all-day auto ride.""",OH

18265,"""No,"" doubtfully answered Plunkett; ""there wasn't any picture of Williams to",OH

18266,be had. And I never saw him myself. I've been sheriff only a year. But I've got,OH

18267,a pretty accurate description of him. About 5 feet 11; dark-hair and eyes; nose,OH

18268,"inclined to be Roman; heavy about the shoulders; strong, white teeth, with",OH

18269,"none missing; laughs a good deal, talkative; drinks considerably but never to",OH

18270,intoxication; looks you square in the eye when talking; age thirty-five. Which,OH

18271,"one of your men does that description fit?""",OH

18272,The consul grinned broadly.,OH

18273,"""I'll tell you what you do,"" he said, laying down his rifle and slipping on his",OH

18274,"dingy black alpaca coat. ""You come along, Mr. Plunkett, and I'll take you up to",OH

18275,see the boys. If you can tell which one of 'em your description fits better than,OH

18276,"it does the other you have the advantage of me.""",OH

18277,Bridger conducted the sheriff out and along the hard beach close to which the,OH

18278,tiny houses of the village were distributed. Immediately back of the town rose,OH

18279,"sudden, small, thickly wooded hills. Up one of these, by means of steps cut in",OH

18280,"the hard clay, the consul led Plunkett. On the very verge of an eminence was",OH

18281,perched a two-room wooden cottage with a thatched roof. A Carib woman was,OH

18282,washing clothes outside. The consul ushered the sheriff to the door of the,OH

18283,room that overlooked the harbour.,OH

18284,"Two men were in the room, about to sit down, in their shirt sleeves, to a table",OH

18285,spread for dinner. They bore little resemblance one to the other in detail; but,OH

18286,the general description given by Plunkett could have been justly applied to,OH

18287,"either. In height, colour of hair, shape of nose, build and manners each of them",OH

18288,"tallied with it. They were fair types of jovial, ready-witted, broad-gauged",OH

18289,Americans who had gravitated together for companionship in an alien land.,OH

18290,"""Hello, Bridger"" they called in unison at sight Of the consul. ""Come and have",OH

18291,"dinner with us!"" And then they noticed Plunkett at his heels, and came forward",OH

18292,with hospitable curiosity.,OH

18293,"""Gentlemen,"" said the consul, his voice taking on unaccustomed formality,",OH

18294,"""this is Mr. Plunkett. Mr. Plunkett�Mr. Reeves and Mr. Morgan.""",OH

18295,The cocoanut barons greeted the newcomer joyously. Reeves seemed about an,OH

18296,"inch taller than Morgan, but his laugh was not quite as loud. Morgan's eyes",OH

18297,were deep brown; Reeves's were black. Reeves was the host and busied,OH

18298,himself with fetching other chairs and calling to the Carib woman for,OH

18299,supplemental table ware. It was explained that Morgan lived in a bamboo,OH

18300,"shack to �loo'ard,� but that every day the two friends dined together. Plunkett",OH

18301,"stood still during the preparations, looking about mildly with his pale-blue",OH

18302,eyes. Bridger looked apologetic and uneasy.,OH

18303,At length two other covers were laid and the company was assigned to places.,OH

18304,Reeves and Morgan stood side by side across the table from the visitors.,OH

18305,Reeves nodded genially as a signal for all to seat themselves. And then,OH

18306,suddenly Plunkett raised his hand with a gesture of authority. He was looking,OH

18307,straight between Reeves and Morgan.,OH

18308,"""Wade Williams,"" he said quietly, ""you are under arrest for murder.""",OH

18309,"Reeves and Morgan instantly exchanged a quick, bright glance, the quality of",OH

18310,"which was interrogation, with a seasoning of surprise. Then, simultaneously",OH

18311,they turned to the speaker with a puzzled and frank deprecation in their gaze.,OH

18312,"""Can't say that we understand you, Mr. Plunkett,"" said Morgan, cheerfully.",OH

18313,"""Did you say 'Williams'?""",OH

18314,"""What's the joke, Bridgy?"" asked Reeves, turning, to the consul with a smile.",OH

18315,Before Bridger could answer Plunkett spoke again.,OH

18316,"""I'll explain,"" he said, quietly. ""One of you don't need any explanation, but this",OH

18317,"is for the other one. One of you is Wade Williams of Chatham County,",OH

18318,"Kentucky. You murdered your wife on May 5, two years ago, after ill-treating",OH

18319,and abusing her continually for five years. I have the proper papers in my,OH

18320,"pocket for taking you back with me, and you are going. We will return on the",OH

18321,fruit steamer that comes back by this island to-morrow to leave its inspectors. I,OH

18322,"acknowledge, gentlemen, that I'm not quite sure which one of you is Williams.",OH

18323,But Wade Williams goes back to Chatham County to-morrow. I want you to,OH

18324,"understand that.""",OH

18325,A great sound of merry laughter from Morgan and Reeves went out over the,OH

18326,still harbour. Two or three fishermen in the fleet of sloops anchored there,OH

18327,looked up at the house of the diablos Americanos on the hill and wondered.,OH

18328,"""My dear Mr. Plunkett,"" cried Morgan, conquering his mirth, ""the dinner is",OH

18329,"getting, cold. Let us sit down and eat. I am anxious to get my spoon into that",OH

18330,"shark-fin soup. Business afterward.""",OH

18331,"""Sit down, gentlemen, if you please,"" added Reeves, pleasantly. ""I am sure Mr.",OH

18332,Plunkett will not object. Perhaps a little time may be of advantage to him in,OH

18333,"identifying�the gentleman he wishes to arrest.""",OH

18334,"""No objections, I'm sure,"" said Plunkett, dropping into his chair heavily. ""I'm",OH

18335,hungry myself. I didn't want to accept the hospitality of you folks without,OH

18336,"giving you notice; that's all.""",OH

18337,Reeves set bottles and glasses on the table.,OH

18338,"""There's cognac,"" he said, ""and anisada, and Scotch 'smoke,' and rye. Take",OH

18339,"your choice.""",OH

18340,"Bridger chose rye, Reeves poured three fingers of Scotch for himself, Morgan",OH

18341,"took the same. The sheriff, against much protestation, filled his glass from the",OH

18342,water bottle.,OH

18343,"""Here's to the appetite,"" said Reeves, raising his glass, ""of Mr. Williams!""",OH

18344,Morgan's laugh and his drink encountering sent him into a choking splutter.,OH

18345,"All began to pay attention to the dinner, which was well cooked and palatable.",OH

18346,"""Williams!"" called Plunkett, suddenly and sharply.",OH

18347,All looked up wonderingly. Reeves found the sheriff's mild eye resting upon,OH

18348,him. He flushed a little.,OH

18349,"""See here,"" he said, with some asperity, ""my name's Reeves, and I don't want",OH

18350,"you to�"" But the comedy of the thing came to his rescue, and he ended with a",OH

18351,laugh.,OH

18352,"""I suppose, Mr. Plunkett,"" said Morgan, carefully seasoning an alligator pear,",OH

18353,"""that you are aware of the fact that you will import a good deal of trouble for",OH

18354,"yourself into Kentucky if you take back the wrong man�that is, of course, if",OH

18355,"you take anybody back?""",OH

18356,"""Thank you for the salt,"" said the sheriff. ""Oh, I'll take somebody back. It'll be",OH

18357,"one of you two gentlemen. Yes, I know I'd get stuck for damages if I make a",OH

18358,"mistake. But I'm going to try to get the right man.""",OH

18359,"""I'll tell you what you do,"" said Morgan, leaning forward with a jolly twinkle",OH

18360,"in his eyes. ""You take me. I'll go without any trouble. The cocoanut business",OH

18361,"hasn't panned out well this year, and I'd like to make some extra money out of",OH

18362,"your bondsmen.""",OH

18363,"""That's not fair,"" chimed in Reeves. ""I got only $16 a thousand for my last",OH

18364,"shipment. Take me, Mr. Plunkett.""",OH

18365,"""I'll take Wade Williams,"" said the sheriff, patiently, ""or I'll come pretty close",OH

18366,"to it.""",OH

18367,"""It's like dining with a ghost,"" remarked Morgan, with a pretended shiver.",OH

18368,"""The ghost of a murderer, too! Will somebody pass the toothpicks to the shade",OH

18369,"of the naughty Mr. Williams?""",OH

18370,Plunkett seemed as unconcerned as if he were dining at his own table in,OH

18371,"Chatham County. He was a gallant trencherman, and the strange tropic viands",OH

18372,"tickled his palate. Heavy, commonplace, almost slothful in his movements, he",OH

18373,appeared to be devoid of all the cunning and watchfulness of the sleuth. He,OH

18374,"even ceased to observe, with any sharpness or attempted discrimination, the",OH

18375,"two men, one of whom he had undertaken with surprising self-confidence, to",OH

18376,"drag away upon the serious charge of wife-murder. Here, indeed, was a",OH

18377,problem set before him that if wrongly solved would have amounted to his,OH

18378,"serious discomfiture, yet there he sat puzzling his soul (to all appearances)",OH

18379,over the novel flavour of a broiled iguana cutlet.,OH

18380,The consul felt a decided discomfort. Reeves and Morgan were his friends and,OH

18381,pals; yet the sheriff from Kentucky had a certain right to his official aid and,OH

18382,moral support. So Bridger sat the silentest around the board and tried to,OH

18383,estimate the peculiar situation. His conclusion was that both Reeves and,OH

18384,"Morgan, quickwitted, as he knew them to be, had conceived at the moment of",OH

18385,Plunkett's disclosure of his mission�and in the brief space of a lightning flash,OH

18386,�the idea that the other might be the guilty Williams; and that each of them,OH

18387,had decided in that moment loyally to protect his comrade against the doom,OH

18388,that threatened him. This was the consul's theory and if he had been a,OH

18389,bookmaker at a race of wits for life and liberty he would have offered heavy,OH

18390,"odds against the plodding sheriff from Chatham County, Kentucky.",OH

18391,When the meal was concluded the Carib woman came and removed the dishes,OH

18392,"and cloth. Reeves strewed the table with excellent cigars, and Plunkett, with",OH

18393,"the others, lighted one of these with evident gratification.",OH

18394,"""I may be dull,"" said Morgan, with a grin and a wink at Bridger; ""but I want to",OH

18395,"know if I am. Now, I say this is all a joke of Mr. Plunkett's, concocted to",OH

18396,frighten two babes-in-the-woods. Is this Williamson to be taken seriously or,OH

18397,"not?""",OH

18398,"""'Williams,'"" corrected Plunkett gravely. ""I never got off any jokes in my life. I",OH

18399,"know I wouldn't travel 2,000 miles to get off a poor one as this would be if I",OH

18400,"didn't take Wade Williams back with me. Gentlemen!"" continued the sheriff,",OH

18401,now letting his mild eyes travel impartially from one of the company to,OH

18402,"another, ""see if you can find any joke in this case. Wade Williams is listening",OH

18403,"to the words I utter now; but out of politeness, I will speak of him as a third",OH

18404,person. For five years he made his wife lead the life of a dog�No; I'll take,OH

18405,that back. No dog in Kentucky was ever treated as she was. He spent the,OH

18406,"money that she brought him�spent it at races, at the card table and on horses",OH

18407,"and hunting. He was a good fellow to his friends, but a cold, sullen demon at",OH

18408,home. He wound up the five years of neglect by striking her with his closed,OH

18409,hand�a hand as hard as a stone�when she was ill and weak from suffering.,OH

18410,She died the next day; and he skipped. That's all there is to it. It's enough. I,OH

18411,never saw Williams; but I knew his wife. I'm not a man to tell half. She and I,OH

18412,were keeping company when she met him. She went to Louisville on a visit,OH

18413,and saw him there. I'll admit that he spoilt my chances in no time. I lived then,OH

18414,on the edge of the Cumberland mountains. I was elected sheriff of Chatham,OH

18415,County a year after Wade Williams killed his wife. My official duty sends me,OH

18416,"out here after him; but I'll admit that there's personal feeling, too. And he's",OH

18417,"going back with me. Mr.�er�Reeves, will you pass me a match?",OH

18418,"""Awfully imprudent of Williams,"" said Morgan, putting his feet up against the",OH

18419,"wall, ""to strike a Kentucky lady. Seems to me I've heard they were scrappers.""",OH

18420,"""Bad, bad Williams,"" said Reeves, pouring out more Scotch.",OH

18421,"The two men spoke lightly, but the consul saw and felt the tension and the",OH

18422,"carefulness in their actions and words. ""Good old fellows,"" he said to himself;",OH

18423,"""they're both all right. Each of 'em is standing by the other like a little brick",OH

18424,"church.""",OH

18425,"And then a dog walked into the room where they sat�a black-and-tan hound,",OH

18426,"long-eared, lazy, confident of welcome.",OH

18427,"Plunkett turned his head and looked at the animal, which halted, confidently,",OH

18428,within a few feet of his chair.,OH

18429,"Suddenly the sheriff, with a deep-mouthed oath, left his seat and, bestowed",OH

18430,"upon the dog a vicious and heavy kick, with his ponderous shoe.",OH

18431,"The hound, heartbroken, astonished, with flapping ears and incurved tail,",OH

18432,uttered a piercing yelp of pain and surprise.,OH

18433,"Reeves and the consul remained in their chairs, saying nothing, but astonished",OH

18434,at the unexpected show of intolerance from the easy-going man from Chatham,OH

18435,county.,OH

18436,"But Morgan, with a suddenly purpling face, leaped, to his feet and raised a",OH

18437,threatening arm above the guest.,OH

18438,"""You�brute!"" he shouted, passionately; ""why did you do that?""",OH

18439,"Quickly the amenities returned, Plunkett muttered some indistinct apology and",OH

18440,regained his seat. Morgan with a decided effort controlled his indignation and,OH

18441,also returned to his chair.,OH

18442,"And then Plunkett with the spring of a tiger, leaped around the corner of the",OH

18443,table and snapped handcuffs on the paralyzed Morgan's wrists.,OH

18444,"""Hound-lover and woman-killer!"" he cried; ""get ready to meet your God.""",OH

18445,When Bridger had finished I asked him:,OH

18446,"""Did he get the right man?""",OH

18447,"""He did,"" said the Consul.",OH

18448,"""And how did he know?"" I inquired, being in a kind of bewilderment.",OH

18449,"""When he put Morgan in the dory,"" answered Bridger, ""the next day to take",OH

18450,"him aboard the Pajaro, this man Plunkett stopped to shake hands with me and I",OH

18451,"asked him the same question.""",OH

18452,"""'Mr. Bridger,' said he, 'I'm a Kentuckian, and I've seen a great deal of both",OH

18453,men and animals. And I never yet saw a man that was overfond of horses and,OH

18454,"dogs but what was cruel to women.'""",OH

18455,III,OH

18456,THE HYPOTHESES OF FAILURE,OH

18457,Lawyer Gooch bestowed his undivided attention upon the engrossing arts of,OH

18458,his profession. But one flight of fancy did he allow his mind to entertain. He,OH

18459,was fond of likening his suite of office rooms to the bottom of a ship. The,OH

18460,"rooms were three in number, with a door opening from one to another. These",OH

18461,doors could also be closed.,OH

18462,"""Ships,"" Lawyer Gooch would say, ""are constructed for safety, with separate,",OH

18463,water-tight compartments in their bottoms. If one compartment springs a leak,OH

18464,it fills with water; but the good ship goes on unhurt. Were it not for the,OH

18465,separating bulkheads one leak would sink the vessel. Now it often happens,OH

18466,"that while I am occupied with clients, other clients with conflicting interests",OH

18467,call. With the assistance of Archibald�an office boy with a future�I cause,OH

18468,"the dangerous influx to be diverted into separate compartments, while I sound",OH

18469,"with my legal plummet the depth of each. If necessary, they may be baled into",OH

18470,"the hallway and permitted to escape by way of the stairs, which we may term",OH

18471,the lee scuppers. Thus the good ship of business is kept afloat; whereas if the,OH

18472,element that supports her were allowed to mingle freely in her hold we might,OH

18473,"be swamped�ha, ha, ha!""",OH

18474,The law is dry. Good jokes are few. Surely it might be permitted Lawyer,OH

18475,"Gooch to mitigate the bore of briefs, the tedium of torts and the prosiness of",OH

18476,processes with even so light a levy upon the good property of humour.,OH

18477,Lawyer Gooch's practice leaned largely to the settlement of marital infelicities.,OH

18478,"Did matrimony languish through complications, he mediated, soothed and",OH

18479,"arbitrated. Did it suffer from implications, he readjusted, defended and",OH

18480,"championed. Did it arrive at the extremity of duplications, he always got light",OH

18481,sentences for his clients.,OH

18482,"But not always was Lawyer Gooch the keen, armed, wily belligerent, ready",OH

18483,with his two-edged sword to lop off the shackles of Hymen. He had been,OH

18484,"known to build up instead of demolishing, to reunite instead of severing, to",OH

18485,lead erring and foolish ones back into the fold instead of scattering the flock.,OH

18486,"Often had he by his eloquent and moving appeals sent husband and wife,",OH

18487,"weeping, back into each other's arms. Frequently he had coached childhood so",OH

18488,"successfully that, at the psychological moment (and at a given signal) the",OH

18489,"plaintive pipe of ""Papa, won't you tum home adain to me and muvver?"" had",OH

18490,won the day and upheld the pillars of a tottering home.,OH

18491,Unprejudiced persons admitted that Lawyer Gooch received as big fees from,OH

18492,these reyoked clients as would have been paid him had the cases been,OH

18493,"contested in court. Prejudiced ones intimated that his fees were doubled,",OH

18494,"because the penitent couples always came back later for the divorce, anyhow.",OH

18495,There came a season in June when the legal ship of Lawyer Gooch (to borrow,OH

18496,his own figure) was nearly becalmed. The divorce mill grinds slowly in June.,OH

18497,It is the month of Cupid and Hymen.,OH

18498,"Lawyer Gooch, then, sat idle in the middle room of his clientless suite. A",OH

18499,small anteroom connected�or rather separated�this apartment from the,OH

18500,"hallway. Here was stationed Archibald, who wrested from visitors their cards",OH

18501,or oral nomenclature which he bore to his master while they waited.,OH

18502,"Suddenly, on this day, there came a great knocking at the outermost door.",OH

18503,"Archibald, opening it, was thrust aside as superfluous by the visitor, who",OH

18504,without due reverence at once penetrated to the office of Lawyer Gooch and,OH

18505,threw himself with good-natured insolence into a comfortable chair facing that,OH

18506,gentlemen.,OH

18507,"""You are Phineas C. Gooch, attorney-at-law?"" said the visitor, his tone of",OH

18508,"voice and inflection making his words at once a question, an assertion and an",OH

18509,accusation.,OH

18510,"Before committing himself by a reply, the lawyer estimated his possible client",OH

18511,in one of his brief but shrewd and calculating glances.,OH

18512,"The man was of the emphatic type�large-sized, active, bold and debonair in",OH

18513,"demeanour, vain beyond a doubt, slightly swaggering, ready and at ease. He",OH

18514,"was well-clothed, but with a shade too much ornateness. He was seeking a",OH

18515,lawyer; but if that fact would seem to saddle him with troubles they were not,OH

18516,patent in his beaming eye and courageous air.,OH

18517,"""My name is Gooch,"" at length the lawyer admitted. Upon pressure he would",OH

18518,also have confessed to the Phineas C. But he did not consider it good practice,OH

18519,"to volunteer information. ""I did not receive your card,"" he continued, by way",OH

18520,"of rebuke, ""so I�""",OH

18521,"""I know you didn't,"" remarked the visitor, coolly; ""And you won't just yet.",OH

18522,"Light up?"" He threw a leg over an arm of his chair, and tossed a handful of",OH

18523,rich-hued cigars upon the table. Lawyer Gooch knew the brand. He thawed,OH

18524,just enough to accept the invitation to smoke.,OH

18525,"""You are a divorce lawyer,"" said the cardless visitor. This time there was no",OH

18526,interrogation in his voice. Nor did his words constitute a simple assertion.,OH

18527,"They formed a charge�a denunciation�as one would say to a dog: ""You are",OH

18528,"a dog."" Lawyer Gooch was silent under the imputation.",OH

18529,"""You handle,"" continued the visitor, ""all the various ramifications of busted-up",OH

18530,"connubiality. You are a surgeon, we might saw, who extracts Cupid's darts",OH

18531,"when he shoots 'em into the wrong parties. You furnish patent, incandescent",OH

18532,lights for premises where the torch of Hymen has burned so low you can't,OH

18533,"light a cigar at it. Am I right, Mr. Gooch?""",OH

18534,"""I have undertaken cases,"" said the lawyer, guardedly, ""in the line to which",OH

18535,your figurative speech seems to refer. Do you wish to consult me,OH

18536,"professionally, Mr. ����"" The lawyer paused, with significance.",OH

18537,"""Not yet,"" said the other, with an arch wave of his cigar, ""not just yet. Let us",OH

18538,approach the subject with the caution that should have been used in the,OH

18539,original act that makes this pow-wow necessary. There exists a matrimonial,OH

18540,jumble to be straightened out. But before I give you names I want your honest,OH

18541,"�well, anyhow, your professional opinion on the merits of the mix-up. I want",OH

18542,you to size up the catastrophe�abstractly�you understand? I'm Mr. Nobody;,OH

18543,and I've got a story to tell you. Then you say what's what. Do you get my,OH

18544,"wireless?""",OH

18545,"""You want to state a hypothetical case?"" suggested Lawyer Gooch.",OH

18546,"""That's the word I was after. 'Apothecary' was the best shot I could make at it",OH

18547,in my mind. The hypothetical goes. I'll state the case. Suppose there's a,OH

18548,woman�a deuced fine-looking woman�who has run away from her husband,OH

18549,and home? She's badly mashed on another man who went to her town to work,OH

18550,"up some real estate business. Now, we may as well call this woman's husband",OH

18551,"Thomas R. Billings, for that's his name. I'm giving you straight tips on the",OH

18552,cognomens. The Lothario chap is Henry K. Jessup. The Billingses lived in a,OH

18553,"little town called Susanville�a good many miles from here. Now, Jessup",OH

18554,leaves Susanville two weeks ago. The next day Mrs. Billings follows him.,OH

18555,"She's dead gone on this man Jessup; you can bet your law library on that.""",OH

18556,Lawyer Gooch's client said this with such unctuous satisfaction that even the,OH

18557,callous lawyer experienced a slight ripple of repulsion. He now saw clearly in,OH

18558,"his fatuous visitor the conceit of the lady-killer, the egoistic complacency of",OH

18559,the successful trifler.,OH

18560,"""Now,"" continued the visitor, ""suppose this Mrs. Billings wasn't happy at",OH

18561,home? We'll say she and her husband didn't gee worth a cent. They've got,OH

18562,"incompatibility to burn. The things she likes, Billings wouldn't have as a gift",OH

18563,with trading-stamps. It's Tabby and Rover with them all the time. She's an,OH

18564,"educated woman in science and culture, and she reads things out loud at",OH

18565,meetings. Billings is not on. He don't appreciate progress and obelisks and,OH

18566,"ethics, and things of that sort. Old Billings is simply a blink when it comes to",OH

18567,"such things. The lady is out and out above his class. Now, lawyer, don't it look",OH

18568,like a fair equalization of rights and wrongs that a woman like that should be,OH

18569,allowed to throw down Billings and take the man that can appreciate her?,OH

18570,"""Incompatibility,"" said Lawyer Gooch, ""is undoubtedly the source of much",OH

18571,"marital discord and unhappiness. Where it is positively proved, divorce would",OH

18572,seem to be the equitable remedy. Are you�excuse me�is this man Jessup,OH

18573,"one to whom the lady may safely trust her future?""",OH

18574,"""Oh, you can bet on Jessup,"" said the client, with a confident wag of his head.",OH

18575,"""Jessup's all right. He'll do the square thing. Why, he left Susanville just to",OH

18576,"keep people from talking about Mrs. Billings. But she followed him up, and",OH

18577,"now, of course, he'll stick to her. When she gets a divorce, all legal and proper,",OH

18578,"Jessup will do the proper thing.""",OH

18579,"""And now,"" said Lawyer Gooch, ""continuing the hypothesis, if you prefer, and",OH

18580,"supposing that my services should be desired in the case, what�""",OH

18581,The client rose impulsively to his feet.,OH

18582,"""Oh, dang the hypothetical business,"" he exclaimed, impatiently. ""Let's let her",OH

18583,"drop, and get down to straight talk. You ought to know who I am by this time.",OH

18584,I want that woman to have her divorce. I'll pay for it. The day you set Mrs.,OH

18586,Lawyer Gooch's client banged his fist upon the table to punctuate his,OH

18588,"""If that is the case�"" began the lawyer.",OH

18589,"""Lady to see you, sir,"" bawled Archibald, bouncing in from his anteroom. He",OH

18590,had orders to always announce immediately any client that might come. There,OH

18591,was no sense in turning business away.,OH

18592,Lawyer Gooch took client number one by the arm and led him suavely into,OH

18593,"one of the adjoining rooms. ""Favour me by remaining here a few minutes, sir,""",OH

18594,"said he. ""I will return and resume our consultation with the least possible",OH

18596,"with a will. I will not keep you waiting long.""",OH

18597,"The breezy gentleman seated himself with obliging acquiescence, and took up",OH

18600,"""Show the lady in, Archibald,"" he said to the office boy, who was awaiting the",OH

18601,order.,OH

18602,"A tall lady, of commanding presence and sternly handsome, entered the room.",OH

18606,ample and fluent. She accepted a chair.,OH

18607,"""Are you Mr. Phineas C. Gooch, the lawyer?"" she asked, in formal and",OH

18608,unconciliatory tones.,OH

18609,"""I am,"" answered Lawyer Gooch, without circumlocution. He never",OH

18610,circumlocuted when dealing with a woman. Women circumlocute. Time is,OH

18611,wasted when both sides in debate employ the same tactics.,OH

18612,"""As a lawyer, sir,"" began the lady, ""you may have acquired some knowledge of",OH

18614,of our artificial social life should stand as an obstacle in the way of a noble,OH

18615,and affectionate heart when it finds its true mate among the miserable and,OH

18622,"""Well, you needn't get so stiff around the gills about it,"" said the lady, with a",OH

18630,"Wilcox�""",OH

18631,"""Mrs. Wilcox is all right,"" cut in the lady, with a hint of asperity. ""And so are",OH

18632,"Tolstoi, and Mrs. Gertrude Atherton, and Omar Khayyam, and Mr. Edward",OH

18634,soul as opposed to the freedom-destroying restrictions of a bigoted and,OH

18635,narrow-minded society. But I will proceed to business. I would prefer to lay,OH

18636,the matter before you in an impersonal way until you pass upon its merits.,OH

18637,"That is to describe it as a supposable instance, without�""",OH

18638,"""You wish to state a hypothetical case?"" said Lawyer Gooch.",OH

18639,"""I was going to say that,"" said the lady, sharply. ""Now, suppose there is a",OH

18640,woman who is all soul and heart and aspirations for a complete existence. This,OH

18641,"woman has a husband who is far below her in intellect, in taste�in",OH

18642,everything. Bah! he is a brute. He despises literature. He sneers at the lofty,OH

18643,thoughts of the world's great thinkers. He thinks only of real estate and such,OH

18644,sordid things. He is no mate for a woman with soul. We will say that this,OH

18645,unfortunate wife one day meets with her ideal�a man with brain and heart,OH

18646,and force. She loves him. Although this man feels the thrill of a new-found,OH

18671,"man of middle age, with a worried and apprehensive expression of",OH

18672,"countenance. He carried in one hand a small satchel, which he set down upon",OH

18673,the floor beside the chair which the lawyer placed for him. His clothing was of,OH

18674,"good quality, but it was worn without regard to neatness or style, and appeared",OH

18675,to be covered with the dust of travel.,OH

18676,"""You make a specialty of divorce cases,"" he said, in, an agitated but businesslike tone.",OH

18677,"""I may say,"" began Lawyer Gooch, ""that my practice has not altogether",OH

18679,"""I know you do,"" interrupted client number three. ""You needn't tell me. I've",OH

18682,"""You wish,"" said Lawyer Gooch, ""to state a hypothetical case.",OH

18683,"""You may call it that. I am a plain man of business. I will be as brief as",OH

18684,possible. We will first take up hypothetical woman. We will say she is married,OH

18685,uncongenially. In many ways she is a superior woman. Physically she is,OH

18686,considered to be handsome. She is devoted to what she calls literature�poetry,OH

18687,"and prose, and such stuff. Her husband is a plain man in the business walks of",OH

18688,"life. Their home has not been happy, although the husband has tried to make it",OH

18689,so. Some time ago a man�a stranger�came to the peaceful town in which,OH

18690,"they lived and engaged in some real estate operations. This woman met him,",OH

18691,and became unaccountably infatuated with him. Her attentions became so,OH

18692,"open that the man felt the community to be no safe place for him, so he left it.",OH

18693,"She abandoned husband and home, and followed him. She forsook her home,",OH

18694,"where she was provided with every comfort, to follow this man who had",OH

18695,inspired her with such a strange affection. Is there anything more to be,OH

18696,"deplored,"" concluded the client, in a trembling voice, ""than the wrecking of a",OH

18697,"home by a woman's uncalculating folly?""",OH

18698,Lawyer Gooch delivered the cautious opinion that there was not.,OH

18699,"""This man she has gone to join,"" resumed the visitor, ""is not the man to make",OH

18700,her happy. It is a wild and foolish self-deception that makes her think he will.,OH

18701,"Her husband, in spite of their many disagreements, is the only one capable of",OH

18702,dealing with her sensitive and peculiar nature. But this she does not realize,OH

18703,"now.""",OH

18704,"""Would you consider a divorce the logical cure in the case you present?"" asked",OH

18705,"Lawyer Gooch, who felt that the conversation was wandering too far from the",OH

18706,field of business.,OH

18707,"""A divorce!"" exclaimed the client, feelingly�almost tearfully. ""No, no�not",OH

18708,"that. I have read, Mr. Gooch, of many instances where your sympathy and",OH

18709,kindly interest led you to act as a mediator between estranged husband and,OH

18710,"wife, and brought them together again. Let us drop the hypothetical case�I",OH

18711,need conceal no longer that it is I who am the sufferer in this sad affair�the,OH

18713,"the man with whom she is infatuated.""",OH

18714,Client number three laid his hand upon Mr. Gooch's arm. Deep emotion was,OH

18715,"written upon his careworn face. ""For Heaven's sake"", he said fervently, ""help",OH

18716,"me in this hour of trouble. Seek out Mrs. Billings, and persuade her to",OH

18717,"abandon this distressing pursuit of her lamentable folly. Tell her, Mr. Gooch,",OH

18718,that her husband is willing to receive her back to his heart and home�promise,OH

18719,her anything that will induce her to return. I have heard of your success in,OH

18720,these matters. Mrs. Billings cannot be very far away. I am worn out with travel,OH

18721,"and weariness. Twice during the pursuit I saw her, but various circumstances",OH

18722,"prevented our having an interview. Will you undertake this mission for me,",OH

18723,"Mr. Gooch, and earn my everlasting gratitude?""",OH

18724,"""It is true,"" said Lawyer Gooch, frowning slightly at the other's last words, but",OH

18725,"immediately calling up an expression of virtuous benevolence, ""that on a",OH

18726,number of occasions I have been successful in persuading couples who sought,OH

18727,the severing of their matrimonial bonds to think better of their rash intentions,OH

18728,and return to their homes reconciled. But I assure you that the work is often,OH

18729,"exceedingly difficult. The amount of argument, perseverance, and, if I may be",OH

18730,"allowed to say it, eloquence that it requires would astonish you. But this is a",OH

18731,case in which my sympathies would be wholly enlisted. I feel deeply for you,OH

18732,"sir, and I would be most happy to see husband and wife reunited. But my",OH

18733,"time,"" concluded the lawyer, looking at his watch as if suddenly reminded of",OH

18734,"the fact, ""is valuable.""",OH

18735,"""I am aware of that,"" said the client, ""and if you will take the case and",OH

18736,persuade Mrs. Billings to return home and leave the man alone that she is,OH

18737,following�on that day I will pay you the sum of one thousand dollars. I have,OH

18738,"made a little money in real estate during the recent boom in Susanville, and I",OH

18739,"will not begrudge that amount.""",OH

18740,"""Retain your seat for a few moments, please,"" said Lawyer Gooch, arising, and",OH

18741,"again consulting his watch. ""I have another client waiting in an adjoining room",OH

18742,"whom I had very nearly forgotten. I will return in the briefest possible space.""",OH

18743,The situation was now one that fully satisfied Lawyer Gooch's love of,OH

18744,intricacy and complication. He revelled in cases that presented such subtle,OH

18745,problems and possibilities. It pleased him to think that he was master of the,OH

18746,"happiness and fate of the three individuals who sat, unconscious of one",OH

18747,"another's presence, within his reach. His old figure of the ship glided into his",OH

18748,"mind. But now the figure failed, for to have filled every compartment of an",OH

18749,actual vessel would have been to endanger her safety; with his compartments,OH

18750,"full, his ship of affairs could but sail on to the advantageous port of a fine, fat",OH

18751,"fee. The thing for him to do, of course, was to wring the best bargain he could",OH

18752,from some one of his anxious cargo.,OH

18753,"First he called to the office boy: ""Lock the outer door, Archibald, and admit no",OH

18754,"one."" Then he moved, with long, silent strides into the room in which client",OH

18755,"number one waited. That gentleman sat, patiently scanning the pictures in the",OH

18756,"magazine, with a cigar in his mouth and his feet upon a table.",OH

18757,"""Well,"" he remarked, cheerfully, as the lawyer entered, ""have you made up",OH

18758,"your mind? Does five hundred dollars go for getting the fair lady a divorce?""",OH

18759,"""You mean that as a retainer?"" asked Lawyer Gooch, softly interrogative.",OH

18760,"""Hey? No; for the whole job. It's enough, ain't it?""",OH

18761,"""My fee,"" said Lawyer Gooch, ""would be one thousand five hundred dollars.",OH

18762,"Five hundred dollars down, and the remainder upon issuance of the divorce.""",OH

18763,A loud whistle came from client number one. His feet descended to the floor.,OH

18764,"""Guess we can't close the deal,"" he said, arising, ""I cleaned up five hundred",OH

18765,dollars in a little real estate dicker down in Susanville. I'd do anything I could,OH

18766,"to free the lady, but it out-sizes my pile.""",OH

18767,"""Could you stand one thousand two hundred dollars?"" asked the lawyer,",OH

18771,"""Out this way, please,"" said Lawyer Gooch, opening the door that led into the",OH

18772,hallway.,OH

18773,"As the gentleman flowed out of the compartment and down the stairs, Lawyer",OH

18774,"Gooch smiled to himself. ""Exit Mr. Jessup,"" he murmured, as he fingered the",OH

18775,"Henry Clay tuft of hair at his ear. ""And now for the forsaken husband."" He",OH

18776,"returned to the middle office, and assumed a businesslike manner.",OH

18777,"""I understand,"" he said to client number three, ""that you agree to pay one",OH

18778,"thousand dollars if I bring about, or am instrumental in bringing about, the",OH

18779,"return of Mrs. Billings to her home, and her abandonment of her infatuated",OH

18780,pursuit of the man for whom she has conceived such a violent fancy. Also that,OH

18781,"the case is now unreservedly in my hands on that basis. Is that correct?""",OH

18782,"""Entirely"", said the other, eagerly. ""And I can produce the cash any time at two",OH

18783,"hours' notice.""",OH

18784,Lawyer Gooch stood up at his full height. His thin figure seemed to expand.,OH

18785,His thumbs sought the arm-holes of his vest. Upon his face was a look of,OH

18786,sympathetic benignity that he always wore during such undertakings.,OH

18787,"""Then, sir,"" he said, in kindly tones, ""I think I can promise you an early relief",OH

18788,from your troubles. I have that much confidence in my powers of argument,OH

18789,"and persuasion, in the natural impulses of the human heart toward good, and in",OH

18790,"the strong influence of a husband's unfaltering love. Mrs. Billings, sir, is here",OH

18791,"�in that room�"" the lawyer's long arm pointed to the door. ""I will call her in",OH

18792,"at once; and our united pleadings�""",OH

18793,"Lawyer Gooch paused, for client number three had leaped from his chair as if",OH

18794,"propelled by steel springs, and clutched his satchel.",OH

18795,"""What the devil,"" he exclaimed, harshly, ""do you mean? That woman in there!",OH

18796,"I thought I shook her off forty miles back.""",OH

18797,"He ran to the open window, looked out below, and threw one leg over the sill.",OH

18798,"""Stop!"" cried Lawyer Gooch, in amazement. ""What would you do? Come, Mr.",OH

18799,"Billings, and face your erring but innocent wife. Our combined entreaties",OH

18800,"cannot fail to�""",OH

18801,"""Billings!"" shouted the now thoroughly moved client. ""I'll Billings you, you",OH

18802,"old idiot!""",OH

18803,"Turning, he hurled his satchel with fury at the lawyer's head. It struck that",OH

18804,"astounded peacemaker between the eyes, causing him to stagger backward a",OH

18805,pace or two. When Lawyer Gooch recovered his wits he saw that his client,OH

18806,"had disappeared. Rushing to the window, he leaned out, and saw the recreant",OH

18807,gathering himself up from the top of a shed upon which he had dropped from,OH

18808,the second-story window. Without stopping to collect his hat he then plunged,OH

18809,"downward the remaining ten feet to the alley, up which he flew with",OH

18810,prodigious celerity until the surrounding building swallowed him up from,OH

18811,view.,OH

18812,Lawyer Gooch passed his hand tremblingly across his brow. It was a habitual,OH

18813,"act with him, serving to clear his thoughts. Perhaps also it now seemed to",OH

18814,soothe the spot where a very hard alligator-hide satchel had struck.,OH

18815,"The satchel lay upon the floor, wide open, with its contents spilled about.",OH

18816,"Mechanically, Lawyer Gooch stooped to gather up the articles. The first was a",OH

18817,"collar; and the omniscient eye of the man of law perceived, wonderingly, the",OH

18818,"initials H. K. J. marked upon it. Then came a comb, a brush, a folded map, and",OH

18819,"a piece of soap. Lastly, a handful of old business letters, addressed�every one",OH

18820,"of them�to ""Henry K. Jessup, Esq.""",OH

18821,"Lawyer Gooch closed the satchel, and set it upon the table. He hesitated for a",OH

18828,CALLOWAY'S CODE,OH

18829,The New York Enterprise sent H. B. Calloway as special correspondent to the,OH

18830,Russo-Japanese-Portsmouth war.,OH

18831,"For two months Calloway hung about Yokohama and Tokio, shaking dice with",OH

18832,"the other correspondents for drinks of 'rickshaws�oh, no, that's something to",OH

18833,"ride in; anyhow, he wasn't earning the salary that his paper was paying him.",OH

18834,But that was not Calloway's fault. The little brown men who held the strings of,OH

18835,Fate between their fingers were not ready for the readers of the Enterprise to,OH

18836,season their breakfast bacon and eggs with the battles of the descendants of,OH

18837,the gods.,OH

18838,But soon the column of correspondents that were to go out with the First Army,OH

18839,tightened their field-glass belts and went down to the Yalu with Kuroki.,OH

18840,Calloway was one of these.,OH

18841,"Now, this is no history of the battle of the Yalu River. That has been told in",OH

18842,detail by the correspondents who gazed at the shrapnel smoke rings from a,OH

18843,"distance of three miles. But, for justice's sake, let it be understood that the",OH

18844,Japanese commander prohibited a nearer view.,OH

18845,Calloway's feat was accomplished before the battle. What he did was to,OH

18846,furnish the Enterprise with the biggest beat of the war. That paper published,OH

18847,exclusively and in detail the news of the attack on the lines of the Russian,OH

18848,General on the same day that it was made. No other paper printed a word,OH

18849,"about it for two days afterward, except a London paper, whose account was",OH

18850,absolutely incorrect and untrue.,OH

18851,Calloway did this in face of the fact that General Kuroki was making his,OH

18852,moves and laying his plans with the profoundest secrecy as far as the world,OH

18853,outside his camps was concerned. The correspondents were forbidden to send,OH

18854,out any news whatever of his plans; and every message that was allowed on,OH

18855,the wires was censored with rigid severity.,OH

18856,The correspondent for the London paper handed in a cablegram describing,OH

18857,Kuroki's plans; but as it was wrong from beginning to end the censor grinned,OH

18858,and let it go through.,OH

18859,"So, there they were�Kuroki on one side of the Yalu with forty-two thousand",OH

18860,"infantry, five thousand cavalry, and one hundred and twenty-four guns. On the",OH

18861,"other side, Zassulitch waited for him with only twenty-three thousand men,",OH

18862,and with a long stretch of river to guard. And Calloway had got hold of some,OH

18863,important inside information that he knew would bring the Enterprise staff,OH

18864,around a cablegram as thick as flies around a Park Row lemonade stand. If he,OH

18865,could only get that message past the censor�the new censor who had arrived,OH

18866,and taken his post that day!,OH

18867,Calloway did the obviously proper thing. He lit his pipe and sat down on a gun,OH

18868,carriage to think it over. And there we must leave him; for the rest of the story,OH

18869,"belongs to Vesey, a sixteen-dollar-a-week reporter on the Enterprise.",OH

18870,Calloway's cablegram was handed to the managing editor at four o'clock in the,OH

18871,afternoon. He read it three times; and then drew a pocket mirror from a,OH

18872,"pigeon-hole in his desk, and looked at his reflection carefully. Then he went",OH

18873,"over to the desk of Boyd, his assistant (he usually called Boyd when he",OH

18874,"wanted him), and laid the cablegram before him.",OH

18903,"""Just what I was asking,"" said the m.e. ""Hustle everybody up that ought to",OH

18948,"to hand his picture over to Vesey. Vesey always wrote his own news stories,",OH

18949,"except the big ones, which were sent to the rewrite men. Add to this fact that",OH

18950,"among all the inhabitants, temples, and groves of the earth nothing existed that",OH

18951,"could abash Vesey, and his dim sketch is concluded.",OH

18952,Vesey butted into the circle of cipher readers very much as Heffelbauer's,OH

18953,"""code"" would have done, and asked what was up. Some one explained, with",OH

18954,the touch of half-familiar condescension that they always used toward him.,OH

18955,Vesey reached out and took the cablegram from the m. e.'s hand. Under the,OH

18956,"protection of some special Providence, he was always doing appalling things",OH

18957,"like that, and coming, off unscathed.",OH

18958,"""It's a code,"" said Vesey. ""Anybody got the key?""",OH

18959,"""The office has no code,"" said Boyd, reaching for the message. Vesey held to",OH

18960,it.,OH

18961,"""Then old Calloway expects us to read it, anyhow,"" said he. ""He's up a tree, or",OH

18962,"something, and he's made this up so as to get it by the censor. It's up to us.",OH

18963,"Gee! I wish they had sent me, too. Say�we can't afford to fall down on our",OH

18968,"""I believe I've got a line on it,"" said Vesey. ""Give me ten minutes.""",OH

18969,"He walked to his desk, threw his hat into a waste-basket, spread out flat on his",OH

18970,"chest like a gorgeous lizard, and started his pencil going. The wit and wisdom",OH

18971,"of the Enterprise remained in a loose group, and smiled at one another,",OH

18972,nodding their heads toward Vesey. Then they began to exchange their theories,OH

18973,about the cipher.,OH

18974,It took Vesey exactly fifteen minutes. He brought to the m. e. a pad with the,OH

18975,code-key written on it.,OH

18976,"""I felt the swing of it as soon as I saw it,"" said Vesey. ""Hurrah for old",OH

19007,"""It's simply newspaper English,"" explained Vesey. ""I've been reporting on the",OH

19023,are to be discharged or retained at a larger salary. Somebody send Ames to,OH

19024,"me.""",OH

19025,"Ames was the king-pin, the snowy-petalled Marguerite, the star-bright looloo",OH

19027,"cyclones in the summer zephyr, lost children in every top-spinning urchin, an",OH

19028,uprising of the down-trodden masses in every hurling of a derelict potato at a,OH

19030,Brooklyn villa playing checkers with his ten-year-old son.,OH

19031,"Ames and the ""war editor"" shut themselves in a room. There was a map in",OH

19032,there stuck full of little pins that represented armies and divisions. Their,OH

19033,fingers had been itching for days to move those pins along the crooked line of,OH

19034,the Yalu. They did so now; and in words of fire Ames translated Calloway's,OH

19035,brief message into a front page masterpiece that set the world talking. He told,OH

19036,of the secret councils of the Japanese officers; gave Kuroki's flaming speeches,OH

19037,in full; counted the cavalry and infantry to a man and a horse; described the,OH

19038,"quick and silent building, of the bridge at Suikauchen, across which the",OH

19039,"Mikado's legions were hurled upon the surprised Zassulitch, whose troops",OH

19040,"were widely scattered along the river. And the battle!�well, you know what",OH

19041,Ames can do with a battle if you give him just one smell of smoke for a,OH

19042,"foundation. And in the same story, with seemingly supernatural knowledge, he",OH

19043,gleefully scored the most profound and ponderous paper in England for the,OH

19044,false and misleading account of the intended movements of the Japanese First,OH

19045,Army printed in its issue of the same date.,OH

19046,Only one error was made; and that was the fault of the cable operator at Wi-ju.,OH

19047,"Calloway pointed it out after he came back. The word ""great"" in his code",OH

19048,"should have been ""gage,"" and its complemental words ""of battle."" But it went",OH

19049,"to Ames ""conditions white,"" and of course he took that to mean snow. His",OH

19050,"description of the Japanese army struggling through the snowstorm, blinded",OH

19051,"by the whirling flakes, was thrillingly vivid. The artists turned out some",OH

19052,effective illustrations that made a hit as pictures of the artillery dragging their,OH

19053,"guns through the drifts. But, as the attack was made on the first day of May,",OH

19054,"""conditions white"" excited some amusement. But it in made no difference to",OH

19055,"the Enterprise, anyway.",OH

19056,It was wonderful. And Calloway was wonderful in having made the new,OH

19057,censor believe that his jargon of words meant no more than a complaint of the,OH

19058,dearth of news and a petition for more expense money. And Vesey was,OH

19059,"wonderful. And most wonderful of all are words, and how they make friends",OH

19062,"On the second day following, the city editor halted at Vesey's desk where the",OH

19069,A MATTER OF MEAN ELEVATION,OH

19070,One winter the Alcazar Opera Company of New Orleans made a speculative,OH

19071,"trip along the Mexican, Central American and South American coasts. The",OH

19072,"venture proved a most successful one. The music-loving, impressionable",OH

19073,"Spanish-Americans deluged the company with dollars and ""vivas."" The",OH

19074,manager waxed plump and amiable. But for the prohibitive climate he would,OH

19075,"have put forth the distinctive flower of his prosperity�the overcoat of fur,",OH

19076,"braided, frogged and opulent. Almost was he persuaded to raise the salaries of",OH

19077,his company. But with a mighty effort he conquered the impulse toward such,OH

19078,an unprofitable effervescence of joy.,OH

19079,"At Macuto, on the coast of Venezuela, the company scored its greatest success.",OH

19080,Imagine Coney Island translated into Spanish and you will comprehend,OH

19081,Macuto. The fashionable season is from November to March. Down from La,OH

19082,Guayra and Caracas and Valencia and other interior towns flock the people for,OH

19083,their holiday season. There are bathing and fiestas and bull fights and scandal.,OH

19084,And then the people have a passion for music that the bands in the plaza and,OH

19085,on the sea beach stir but do not satisfy. The coming of the Alcazar Opera,OH

19086,Company aroused the utmost ardour and zeal among the pleasure seekers.,OH

19087,"The illustrious Guzman Blanco, President and Dictator of Venezuela,",OH

19088,sojourned in Macuto with his court for the season. That potent ruler�who,OH

19089,"himself paid a subsidy of 40,000 pesos each year to grand opera in Caracas�",OH

19090,ordered one of the Government warehouses to be cleared for a temporary,OH

19091,theatre. A stage was quickly constructed and rough wooden benches made for,OH

19092,the audience. Private boxes were added for the use of the President and the,OH

19093,notables of the army and Government.,OH

19094,The company remained in Macuto for two weeks. Each performance filled the,OH

19095,house as closely as it could be packed. Then the music-mad people fought for,OH

19096,"room in the open doors and windows, and crowded about, hundreds deep, on",OH

19097,the outside. Those audiences formed a brilliantly diversified patch of colour.,OH

19098,The hue of their faces ranged from the clear olive of the pure-blood Spaniards,OH

19099,down through the yellow and brown shades of the Mestizos to the coal-black,OH

19100,Carib and the Jamaica Negro. Scattered among them were little groups of,OH

19101,"Indians with faces like stone idols, wrapped in gaudy fibre-woven blankets�",OH

19102,Indians down from the mountain states of Zamora and Los Andes and Miranda,OH

19103,to trade their gold dust in the coast towns.,OH

19104,The spell cast upon these denizens of the interior fastnesses was remarkable.,OH

19105,"They sat in petrified ecstasy, conspicuous among the excitable Macutians, who",OH

19106,wildly strove with tongue and hand to give evidence of their delight. Only,OH

19107,once did the sombre rapture of these aboriginals find expression. During the,OH

19108,"rendition of ""Faust,"" Guzman Blanco, extravagantly pleased by the ""Jewel",OH

19109,"Song,"" cast upon the stage a purse of gold pieces. Other distinguished citizens",OH

19110,"followed his lead to the extent of whatever loose coin they had convenient,",OH

19111,"while some of the fair and fashionable se�oras were moved, in imitation, to",OH

19112,"fling a jewel or a ring or two at the feet of the Marguerite�who was,",OH

19113,"according to the bills, Mlle. Nina Giraud. Then, from different parts of the",OH

19114,house rose sundry of the stolid hillmen and cast upon the stage little brown,OH

19115,"and dun bags that fell with soft ""thumps"" and did not rebound. It was, no",OH

19116,"doubt, pleasure at the tribute to her art that caused Mlle. Giraud's eyes to shine",OH

19117,so brightly when she opened these little deerskin bags in her dressing room,OH

19118,"and found them to contain pure gold dust. If so, the pleasure was rightly hers,",OH

19119,"for her voice in song, pure, strong and thrilling with the feeling of the",OH

19120,"emotional artist, deserved the tribute that it earned.",OH

19121,But the triumph of the Alcazar Opera Company is not the theme�it but leans,OH

19122,"upon and colours it. There happened in Macuto a tragic thing, an unsolvable",OH

19123,"mystery, that sobered for a time the gaiety of the happy season.",OH

19124,One evening between the short twilight and the time when she should have,OH

19125,"whirled upon the stage in the red and black of the ardent Carmen, Mlle. Nina",OH

19126,"Giraud disappeared from the sight and ken of 6,000 pairs of eyes and as many",OH

19127,minds in Macuto. There was the usual turmoil and hurrying to seek her.,OH

19128,Messengers flew to the little French-kept hotel where she stayed; others of the,OH

19129,company hastened here or there where she might be lingering in some tienda,OH

19130,or unduly prolonging her bath upon the beach. All search was fruitless.,OH

19131,Mademoiselle had vanished.,OH

19132,"Half an hour passed and she did not appear. The dictator, unused to the",OH

19133,"caprices of prime donne, became impatient. He sent an aide from his box to",OH

19134,say to the manager that if the curtain did not at once rise he would,OH

19135,"immediately hale the entire company to the calabosa, though it would desolate",OH

19136,"his heart, indeed, to be compelled to such an act. Birds in Macuto could be",OH

19137,made to sing.,OH

19138,The manager abandoned hope for the time of Mlle. Giraud. A member of the,OH

19139,"chorus, who had dreamed hopelessly for years of the blessed opportunity,",OH

19140,quickly Carmenized herself and the opera went on.,OH

19141,"Afterward, when the lost cantatrice appeared not, the aid of the authorities was",OH

19142,"invoked. The President at once set the army, the police and all citizens to the",OH

19143,search. Not one clue to Mlle. Giraud's disappearance was found. The Alcazar,OH

19144,left to fill engagements farther down the coast.,OH

19145,On the way back the steamer stopped at Macuto and the manager made,OH

19146,anxious inquiry. Not a trace of the lady had been discovered. The Alcazar,OH

19147,could do no more. The personal belongings of the missing lady were stored in,OH

19148,the hotel against her possible later reappearance and the opera company,OH

19149,continued upon its homeward voyage to New Orleans.,OH

19150,On the camino real along the beach the two saddle mules and the four pack,OH

19151,"mules of Don Se�or Johnny Armstrong stood, patiently awaiting the crack of",OH

19152,"the whip of the arriero, Luis. That would be the signal for the start on another",OH

19153,long journey into the mountains. The pack mules were loaded with a varied,OH

19154,assortment of hardware and cutlery. These articles Don Johnny traded to the,OH

19155,interior Indians for the gold dust that they washed from the Andean streams,OH

19156,"and stored in quills and bags against his coming. It was a profitable business,",OH

19157,and Se�or Armstrong expected soon to be able to purchase the coffee,OH

19158,plantation that he coveted.,OH

19159,"Armstrong stood on the narrow sidewalk, exchanging garbled Spanish with",OH

19160,"old Peralto, the rich native merchant who had just charged him four prices for",OH

19161,"half a gross of pot-metal hatchets, and abridged English with Rucker, the little",OH

19162,German who was Consul for the United States.,OH

19170,The bells of Luis's mule jingled and the pack train filed after the warning note.,OH

19171,"Armstrong, waved a good-bye and took his place at the tail of the procession.",OH

19172,"Up the narrow street they turned, and passed the two-story wooden Hotel",OH

19173,"Ingles, where Ives and Dawson and Richards and the rest of the chaps were",OH

19174,"dawdling on the broad piazza, reading week-old newspapers. They crowded to",OH

19175,the railing and shouted many friendly and wise and foolish farewells after him.,OH

19176,"Across the plaza they trotted slowly past the bronze statue of Guzman Blanco,",OH

19177,"within its fence of bayoneted rifles captured from revolutionists, and out of the",OH

19178,town between the rows of thatched huts swarming with the unclothed youth of,OH

19179,Macuto. They plunged into the damp coolness of banana groves at length to,OH

19180,"emerge upon a bright stream, where brown women in scant raiment laundered",OH

19181,"clothes destructively upon the rocks. Then the pack train, fording the stream,",OH

19182,"attacked the sudden ascent, and bade adieu to such civilization as the coast",OH

19183,afforded.,OH

19184,"For weeks Armstrong, guided by Luis, followed his regular route among the",OH

19185,"mountains. After he had collected an arroba of the precious metal, winning a",OH

19186,"profit of nearly $5,000, the heads of the lightened mules were turned downtrail again. Where the head of the Guarico River springs from a great gash in",OH

19187,"the mountain-side, Luis halted the train.",OH

19188,"""Half a day's journey from here, Se�or,"" said he, ""is the village of Tacuzama,",OH

19189,which we have never visited. I think many ounces of gold may be procured,OH

19190,"there. It is worth the trial.""",OH

19191,"Armstrong concurred, and they turned again upward toward Tacuzama. The",OH

19192,"trail was abrupt and precipitous, mounting through a dense forest. As night",OH

19193,"fell, dark and gloomy, Luis once more halted. Before them was a black chasm,",OH

19194,bisecting the path as far as they could see.,OH

19195,"Luis dismounted. ""There should be a bridge,"" he called, and ran along the cleft",OH

19196,"a distance. ""It is here,"" he cried, and remounting, led the way. In a few",OH

19197,"moments Armstrong, heard a sound as though a thunderous drum were beating",OH

19198,somewhere in the dark. It was the falling of the mules' hoofs upon the bridge,OH

19199,made of strong hides lashed to poles and stretched across the chasm. Half a,OH

19200,mile further was Tacuzama. The village was a congregation of rock and mud,OH

19201,huts set in the profundity of an obscure wood. As they rode in a sound,OH

19202,"inconsistent with that brooding solitude met their ears. From a long, low mud",OH

19203,hut that they were nearing rose the glorious voice of a woman in song. The,OH

19204,"words were English, the air familiar to Armstrong's memory, but not to his",OH

19205,musical knowledge.,OH

19206,He slipped from his mule and stole to a narrow window in one end of the,OH

19207,"house. Peering cautiously inside, he saw, within three feet of him, a woman of",OH

19208,"marvellous, imposing beauty, clothed in a splendid loose robe of leopard skins.",OH

19209,The hut was packed close to the small space in which she stood with the,OH

19210,squatting figures of Indians.,OH

19211,"The woman finished her song and seated herself close to the little window, as",OH

19212,if grateful for the unpolluted air that entered it. When she had ceased several,OH

19213,of the audience rose and cast little softly-falling bags at her feet. A harsh,OH

19214,murmur�no doubt a barbarous kind of applause and comment�went through,OH

19215,the grim assembly.,OH

19216,"Armstrong, was used to seizing opportunities promptly. Taking advantage of",OH

19217,"the noise he called to the woman in a low but distinct voice: ""Do not turn your",OH

19218,"head this way, but listen. I am an American. If you need assistance tell me how",OH

19219,"I can render it. Answer as briefly as you can.""",OH

19220,The woman was worthy of his boldness. Only by a sudden flush of her pale,OH

19221,"cheek did she acknowledge understanding of his words. Then she spoke,",OH

19222,scarcely moving her lips.,OH

19223,"""I am held a prisoner by these Indians. God knows I need help. In two hours",OH

19224,come to the little hut twenty yards toward the Mountainside. There will be a,OH

19225,"light and a red curtain in the window. There is always a guard at the door,",OH

19226,"whom you will have to overcome. For the love of heaven, do not fail to",OH

19227,"come.""",OH

19228,The story seems to shrink from adventure and rescue and mystery. The theme,OH

19236,"Did the protoplasm�but enough. The chemists are looking into the matter,",OH

19237,and before long they will have all life in the table of the symbols.,OH

19238,"Briefly, then, in order to confine the story within scientific bounds, John",OH

19239,"Armstrong, went to the hut, choked the Indian guard and carried away Mlle.",OH

19240,Giraud. With her was also conveyed a number of pounds of gold dust she had,OH

19241,collected during her six months' forced engagement in Tacuzama. The,OH

19242,Carabobo Indians are easily the most enthusiastic lovers of music between the,OH

19243,equator and the French Opera House in New Orleans. They are also strong,OH

19244,"believers that the advice of Emerson was good when he said: ""The thing thou",OH

19245,"wantest, O discontented man �take it, and pay the price."" A number of them",OH

19246,"had attended the performance of the Alcazar Opera Company in Macuto, and",OH

19247,"found Mlle. Giraud's style and technique satisfactory. They wanted her, so",OH

19248,they took her one evening suddenly and without any fuss. They treated her,OH

19249,"with much consideration, exacting only one song recital each day. She was",OH

19250,quite pleased at being rescued by Mr. Armstrong. So much for mystery and,OH

19251,adventure. Now to resume the theory of the protoplasm.,OH

19252,"John Armstrong and Mlle. Giraud rode among the Andean peaks, enveloped in",OH

19253,"their greatness and sublimity. The mightiest cousins, furthest removed, in",OH

19254,nature's great family become conscious of the tie. Among those huge piles of,OH

19255,"primordial upheaval, amid those gigantic silences and elongated fields of",OH

19256,distance the littlenesses of men are precipitated as one chemical throws down,OH

19257,"a sediment from another. They moved reverently, as in a temple. Their souls",OH

19258,were uplifted in unison with the stately heights. They travelled in a zone of,OH

19259,majesty and peace.,OH

19260,"To Armstrong the woman seemed almost a holy thing. Yet bathed in the white,",OH

19261,"still dignity of her martyrdom that purified her earthly beauty and gave out, it",OH

19262,"seemed, an aura of transcendent loveliness, in those first hours of",OH

19263,"companionship she drew from him an adoration that was half human love, half",OH

19264,the worship of a descended goddess.,OH

19265,Never yet since her rescue had she smiled. Over her dress she still wore the,OH

19266,"robe of leopard skins, for the mountain air was cold. She looked to be some",OH

19267,splendid princess belonging to those wild and awesome altitudes. The spirit of,OH

19268,the region chimed with hers. Her eyes were always turned upon the sombre,OH

19269,"cliffs, the blue gorges and the snow-clad turrets, looking a sublime melancholy",OH

19270,equal to their own. At times on the journey she sang thrilling te deums and,OH

19271,"misereres that struck the true note of the hills, and made their route seem like a",OH

19272,"solemn march down a cathedral aisle. The rescued one spoke but seldom, her",OH

19273,mood partaking of the hush of nature that surrounded them. Armstrong looked,OH

19274,upon her as an angel. He could not bring himself to the sacrilege of attempting,OH

19275,to woo her as other women may be wooed.,OH

19276,"On the third day they had descended as far as the tierra templada, the zona of",OH

19277,"the table lands and foot hills. The mountains were receding in their rear, but",OH

19278,"still towered, exhibiting yet impressively their formidable heads. Here they",OH

19279,met signs of man. They saw the white houses of coffee plantations gleam,OH

19280,across the clearings. They struck into a road where they met travellers and,OH

19281,pack-mules. Cattle were grazing on the slopes. They passed a little village,OH

19282,where the round-eyed ni�os shrieked and called at sight of them.,OH

19283,Mlle. Giraud laid aside her leopard-skin robe. It seemed to be a trifle,OH

19284,incongruous now. In the mountains it had appeared fitting and natural. And if,OH

19285,Armstrong was not mistaken she laid aside with it something of the high,OH

19286,dignity of her demeanour. As the country became more populous and,OH

19287,"significant of comfortable life he saw, with a feeling of joy, that the exalted",OH

19288,princess and priestess of the Andean peaks was changing to a woman�an,OH

19289,"earth woman, but no less enticing. A little colour crept to the surface of her",OH

19290,marble cheek. She arranged the conventional dress that the removal of the,OH

19291,robe now disclosed with the solicitous touch of one who is conscious of the,OH

19292,eyes of others. She smoothed the careless sweep of her hair. A mundane,OH

19293,"interest, long latent in the chilling atmosphere of the ascetic peaks, showed in",OH

19294,her eyes.,OH

19295,This thaw in his divinity sent Armstrong's heart going faster. So might an,OH

19296,Arctic explorer thrill at his first ken of green fields and liquescent waters.,OH

19297,They were on a lower plane of earth and life and were succumbing to its,OH

19298,"peculiar, subtle influence. The austerity of the hills no longer thinned the air",OH

19299,"they breathed. About them was the breath of fruit and corn and builded homes,",OH

19300,the comfortable smell of smoke and warm earth and the consolations man has,OH

19301,placed between himself and the dust of his brother earth from which he,OH

19302,"sprung. While traversing those awful mountains, Mile. Giraud had seemed to",OH

19303,be wrapped in their spirit of reverent reserve. Was this that same woman�,OH

19304,"now palpitating, warm, eager, throbbing with conscious life and charm,",OH

19305,"feminine to her finger-tips? Pondering over this, Armstrong felt certain",OH

19306,misgivings intrude upon his thoughts. He wished he could stop there with this,OH

19307,"changing creature, descending no farther. Here was the elevation and",OH

19308,environment to which her nature seemed to respond with its best. He feared to,OH

19309,go down upon the man-dominated levels. Would her spirit not yield still,OH

19310,further in that artificial zone to which they were descending?,OH

19311,Now from a little plateau they saw the sea flash at the edge of the green,OH

19312,"lowlands. Mile. Giraud gave a little, catching sigh.",OH

19313,"""Oh! look, Mr. Armstrong, there is the sea! Isn't it lovely? I'm so tired of",OH

19314,"mountains."" She heaved a pretty shoulder in a gesture of repugnance. ""Those",OH

19315,horrid Indians! Just think of what I suffered! Although I suppose I attained my,OH

19316,"ambition of becoming a stellar attraction, I wouldn't care to repeat the",OH

19317,"engagement. It was very nice of you to bring me away. Tell me, Mr.",OH

19318,"Armstrong�honestly, now �do I look such an awful, awful fright? I haven't",OH

19319,"looked into a mirror, you know, for months.""",OH

19320,Armstrong made answer according to his changed moods. Also he laid his,OH

19321,hand upon hers as it rested upon the horn of her saddle. Luis was at the head of,OH

19322,"the pack train and could not see. She allowed it to remain there, and her eyes",OH

19323,smiled frankly into his.,OH

19324,Then at sundown they dropped upon the coast level under the palms and,OH

19325,lemons among the vivid greens and scarlets and ochres of the tierra caliente.,OH

19326,"They rode into Macuto, and saw the line of volatile bathers frolicking in the",OH

19327,surf. The mountains were very far away.,OH

19328,Mlle. Giraud's eyes were shining with a joy that could not have existed under,OH

19329,the chaperonage of the mountain-tops. There were other spirits calling to her,OH

19330,"�nymphs of the orange groves, pixies from the chattering surf, imps, born of",OH

19331,"the music, the perfumes, colours and the insinuating presence of humanity.",OH

19332,"She laughed aloud, musically, at a sudden thought.",OH

19333,"""Won't there be a sensation?"" she called to Armstrong. ""Don't I wish I had an",OH

19334,"engagement just now, though! What a picnic the press agent would have!",OH

19335,'Held a prisoner by a band of savage Indians subdued by the spell of her,OH

19336,wonderful voice'�wouldn't that make great stuff? But I guess I quit the game,OH

19337,"winner, anyhow�there ought to be a couple of thousand dollars in that sack of",OH

19338,"gold dust I collected as encores, don't you think?""",OH

19339,"He left her at the door of the little Hotel de Buen Descansar, where she had",OH

19340,stopped before. Two hours later he returned to the hotel. He glanced in at the,OH

19341,open door of the little combined reception room and cafe.,OH

19342,Half a dozen of Macuto's representative social and official caballeros were,OH

19343,"distributed about the room. Se�or Villablanca, the wealthy rubber",OH

19344,"concessionist, reposed his fat figure on two chairs, with an emollient smile",OH

19345,"beaming upon his chocolate-coloured face. Guilbert, the French mining",OH

19346,"engineer, leered through his polished nose-glasses. Colonel Mendez, of the",OH

19347,"regular army, in gold-laced uniform and fatuous grin, was busily extracting",OH

19348,corks from champagne bottles. Other patterns of Macutian gallantry and,OH

19349,fashion pranced and posed. The air was hazy with cigarette smoke. Wine,OH

19350,dripped upon the floor.,OH

19351,Perched upon a table in the centre of the room in an attitude of easy,OH

19352,pre�minence was Mlle. Giraud. A chic costume of white lawn and cherry,OH

19353,"ribbons supplanted her travelling garb. There was a suggestion of lace, and a",OH

19354,"frill or two, with a discreet, small implication of hand-embroidered pink",OH

19355,"hosiery. Upon her lap rested a guitar. In her face was the light of resurrection,",OH

19356,the peace of elysium attained through fire and suffering. She was singing to a,OH

19357,lively accompaniment a little song:,OH

19358,"""When you see de big round moon",OH

19359,"Comin' up like a balloon,",OH

19362,The singer caught sight of Armstrong.,OH

19363,"""Hi! there, Johnny,"" she called; ""I've been expecting you for an hour. What",OH

19364,kept you? Gee! but these smoked guys are the slowest you ever saw. They ain't,OH

19365,"on, at all. Come along in, and I'll make this coffee-coloured old sport with the",OH

19366,"gold epaulettes open one for you right off the ice.""",OH

19367,"""Thank you,"" said Armstrong; ""not just now, I believe. I've several things to",OH

19368,"attend to.""",OH

19369,"He walked out and down the street, and met Rucker coming up from the",OH

19374,"""GIRL""",OH

19375,In gilt letters on the ground glass of the door of room No. 962 were the words:,OH

19377,"the solid tramp of a drove of prize Percherons, scrub-women were invading",OH

19378,the cloud-capped twenty-story office building. A puff of red-hot air flavoured,OH

19379,"with lemon peelings, soft-coal smoke and train oil came in through the halfopen windows.",OH

19380,"Robbins, fifty, something of an overweight beau, and addicted to first nights",OH

19382,joys.,OH

19383,"""Going to be something doing in the humidity line to-night,"" he said. ""You",OH

19384,"out-of-town chaps will be the people, with your katydids and moonlight and",OH

19385,"long drinks and things out on the front porch.""",OH

19386,"Hartley, twenty-nine, serious, thin, good-looking, nervous, sighed and frowned",OH

19387,a little.,OH

19388,"""Yes,"" said he, ""we always have cool nights in Floralhurst, especially in the",OH

19389,"winter.""",OH

19390,A man with an air of mystery came in the door and went up to Hartley.,OH

19391,"""I've found where she lives,"" he announced in the portentous half-whisper that",OH

19392,makes the detective at work a marked being to his fellow men.,OH

19393,Hartley scowled him into a state of dramatic silence and quietude. But by that,OH

19394,"time Robbins had got his cane and set his tie pin to his liking, and with a",OH

19395,debonair nod went out to his metropolitan amusements.,OH

19396,"""Here is the address,"" said the detective in a natural tone, being deprived of an",OH

19397,audience to foil.,OH

19398,Hartley took the leaf torn out of the sleuth's dingy memorandum book. On it,OH

19399,"were pencilled the words ""Vivienne Arlington, No. 341 East ����th Street,",OH

19400,"care of Mrs. McComus.""",OH

19401,"""Moved there a week ago,"" said the detective. ""Now, if you want any",OH

19402,"shadowing done, Mr. Hartley, I can do you as fine a job in that line as anybody",OH

19403,in the city. It will be only $7 a day and expenses. Can send in a daily,OH

19404,"typewritten report, covering�""",OH

19405,"""You needn't go on,"" interrupted the broker. ""It isn't a case of that kind. I",OH

19406,"merely wanted the address. How much shall I pay you?""",OH

19407,"""One day's work,"" said the sleuth. ""A tenner will cover it.""",OH

19408,Hartley paid the man and dismissed him. Then he left the office and boarded a,OH

19409,Broadway car. At the first large crosstown artery of travel he took an,OH

19410,"eastbound car that deposited him in a decaying avenue, whose ancient",OH

19411,structures once sheltered the pride and glory of the town.,OH

19412,"Walking a few squares, he came to the building that he sought. It was a new",OH

19413,"flathouse, bearing carved upon its cheap stone portal its sonorous name, ""The",OH

19414,"Vallambrosa."" Fire-escapes zigzagged down its front�these laden with",OH

19415,"household goods, drying clothes, and squalling children evicted by the",OH

19416,midsummer heat. Here and there a pale rubber plant peeped from the,OH

19417,"miscellaneous mass, as if wondering to what kingdom it belonged�vegetable,",OH

19418,animal or artificial.,OH

19419,"Hartley pressed the ""McComus"" button. The door latch clicked spasmodically",OH

19420,"�now hospitably, now doubtfully, as though in anxiety whether it might be",OH

19421,admitting friends or duns. Hartley entered and began to climb the stairs after,OH

19422,the manner of those who seek their friends in city flat-houses�which is the,OH

19423,"manner of a boy who climbs an apple-tree, stopping when he comes upon",OH

19424,what he wants.,OH

19425,On the fourth floor he saw Vivienne standing in an open door. She invited him,OH

19426,"inside, with a nod and a bright, genuine smile. She placed a chair for him near",OH

19427,"a window, and poised herself gracefully upon the edge of one of those Jekylland-Hyde pieces of furniture that are masked and mysteriously hooded,",OH

19428,unguessable bulks by day and inquisitorial racks of torture by night.,OH

19429,"Hartley cast a quick, critical, appreciative glance at her before speaking, and",OH

19430,told himself that his taste in choosing had been flawless.,OH

19431,Vivienne was about twenty-one. She was of the purest Saxon type. Her hair,OH

19432,"was a ruddy golden, each filament of the neatly gathered mass shining with its",OH

19433,own lustre and delicate graduation of colour. In perfect harmony were her,OH

19434,ivory-clear complexion and deep sea-blue eyes that looked upon the world,OH

19435,with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the pixie of an undiscovered,OH

19436,mountain stream. Her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of,OH

19437,absolute naturalness. And yet with all her Northern clearness and frankness of,OH

19438,"line and colouring, there seemed to be something of the tropics in her�",OH

19439,"something of languor in the droop of her pose, of love of ease in her ingenious",OH

19440,complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing�,OH

19441,something that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to,OH

19442,"exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beautiful, milk-white",OH

19443,dove among its sober-hued companions.,OH

19444,She was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt�that discreet masquerade of,OH

19445,goose-girl and duchess.,OH

19446,"""Vivienne,"" said Hartley, looking at her pleadingly, ""you did not answer my",OH

19447,last letter. It was only by nearly a week's search that I found where you had,OH

19448,moved to. Why have you kept me in suspense when you knew how anxiously,OH

19449,"I was waiting to see you and hear from you?""",OH

19450,The girl looked out the window dreamily.,OH

19451,"""Mr. Hartley,"" she said hesitatingly, ""I hardly know what to say to you. I",OH

19452,"realize all the advantages of your offer, and sometimes I feel sure that I could",OH

19453,"be contented with you. But, again, I am doubtful. I was born a city girl, and I",OH

19454,"am afraid to bind myself to a quiet suburban life.""",OH

19455,"""My dear girl,"" said Hartley, ardently, ""have I not told you that you shall have",OH

19456,everything that your heart can desire that is in my power to give you? You,OH

19457,"shall come to the city for the theatres, for shopping and to visit your friends as",OH

19458,"often as you care to. You can trust me, can you not?""",OH

19459,"""To the fullest,"" she said, turning her frank eyes upon him with a smile. ""I",OH

19460,"know you are the kindest of men, and that the girl you get will be a lucky one.",OH

19461,"I learned all about you when I was at the Montgomerys'.""",OH

19462,"""Ah!"" exclaimed Hartley, with a tender, reminiscent light in his eye; ""I",OH

19463,remember well the evening I first saw you at the Montgomerys'. Mrs.,OH

19464,Montgomery was sounding your praises to me all the evening. And she hardly,OH

19465,"did you justice. I shall never forget that supper. Come, Vivienne, promise me. I",OH

19466,want you. You'll never regret coming with me. No one else will ever give you,OH

19467,"as pleasant a home.""",OH

19468,The girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands.,OH

19469,A sudden jealous suspicion seized Hartley.,OH

19470,"""Tell me, Vivienne,"" he asked, regarding her keenly, ""is there another�is there",OH

19471,"some one else ?""",OH

19472,A rosy flush crept slowly over her fair cheeks and neck.,OH

19473,"""You shouldn't ask that, Mr. Hartley,"" she said, in some confusion. ""But I will",OH

19474,tell you. There is one other�but he has no right�I have promised him,OH

19475,"nothing.""",OH

19476,"""His name?"" demanded Hartley, sternly.",OH

19477,"""Townsend.""",OH

19478,"""Rafford Townsend!"" exclaimed Hartley, with a grim tightening of his jaw.",OH

19479,"""How did that man come to know you? After all I've done for him�""",OH

19480,"""His auto has just stopped below,"" said Vivienne, bending over the windowsill. ""He's coming for his answer. Oh I don't know what to do!""",OH

19481,The bell in the flat kitchen whirred. Vivienne hurried to press the latch button.,OH

19482,"""Stay here,"" said Hartley. ""I will meet him in the hall.""",OH

19483,"Townsend, looking like a Spanish grandee in his light tweeds, Panama hat and",OH

19484,"curling black mustache, came up the stairs three at a time. He stopped at sight",OH

19485,of Hartley and looked foolish.,OH

19486,"""Go back,"" said Hartley, firmly, pointing downstairs with his forefinger.",OH

19487,"""Hullo!"" said Townsend, feigning surprise. ""What's up? What are you doing",OH

19488,"here, old man?""",OH

19489,"""Go back,"" repeated Hartley, inflexibly. ""The Law of the Jungle. Do you want",OH

19490,"the Pack to tear you in pieces? The kill is mine.""",OH

19491,"""I came here to see a plumber about the bathroom connections,"" said",OH

19492,"Townsend, bravely.",OH

19493,"""All right,"" said Hartley. ""You shall have that lying plaster to stick upon your",OH

19494,"traitorous soul. But, go back."" Townsend went downstairs, leaving a bitter",OH

19495,word to be wafted up the draught of the staircase. Hartley went back to his,OH

19496,wooing.,OH

19497,"""Vivienne,"" said he, masterfully. ""I have got to have you. I will take no more",OH

19499,"""When do you want me?"" she asked.",OH

19500,"""Now. As soon as you can get ready.""",OH

19501,She stood calmly before him and looked him in the eye.,OH

19503,"H�loise is there?""",OH

19505,the carpet once or twice.,OH

19506,"""She shall go,"" he declared grimly. Drops stood upon his brow. ""Why should I",OH

19507,let that woman make my life miserable? Never have I seen one day of freedom,OH

19508,"from trouble since I have known her. You are right, Vivienne. H�loise must be",OH

19794,him down in the bottom of the buggy and drove away. We took him up to the,OH

19795,cave and I hitched the horse in the cedar brake. After dark I drove the buggy to,OH

19796,"the little village, three miles away, where we had hired it, and walked back to",OH

19797,the mountain.,OH

19798,Bill was pasting court-plaster over the scratches and bruises on his features.,OH

19799,"There was a fire burning behind the big rock at the entrance of the cave, and",OH

19800,"the boy was watching a pot of boiling coffee, with two buzzard tail-feathers",OH

19801,"stuck in his red hair. He points a stick at me when I come up, and says:",OH

19803,the plains?,OH

19805,"bruises on his shins. ""We're playing Indian. We're making Buffalo Bill's show",OH

19806,"look like magic-lantern views of Palestine in the town hall. I'm Old Hank, the",OH

19809,"Yes, sir, that boy seemed to be having the time of his life. The fun of camping",OH

19810,out in a cave had made him forget that he was a captive himself. He,OH

19811,"immediately christened me Snake-eye, the Spy, and announced that, when his",OH

19812,"braves returned from the warpath, I was to be broiled at the stake at the rising",OH

19813,of the sun.,OH

19814,Then we had supper; and he filled his mouth full of bacon and bread and,OH

19815,"gravy, and began to talk. He made a during-dinner speech something like this:",OH

19816,"""I like this fine. I never camped out before; but I had a pet 'possum once, and I",OH

19817,was nine last birthday. I hate to go to school. Rats ate up sixteen of Jimmy,OH

19819,I want some more gravy. Does the trees moving make the wind blow? We had,OH

19820,"five puppies. What makes your nose so red, Hank? My father has lots of",OH

19821,"money. Are the stars hot? I whipped Ed Walker twice, Saturday. I don't like",OH

19822,girls. You dassent catch toads unless with a string. Do oxen make any noise?,OH

19823,Why are oranges round? Have you got beds to sleep on in this cave? Amos,OH

19825,"many does it take to make twelve?""",OH

19826,"Every few minutes he would remember that he was a pesky redskin, and pick",OH

19827,up his stick rifle and tiptoe to the mouth of the cave to rubber for the scouts of,OH

19828,the hated paleface. Now and then he would let out a war-whoop that made Old,OH

19829,Hank the Trapper shiver. That boy had Bill terrorized from the start.,OH

19830,"""Red Chief,"" says I to the kid, ""would you like to go home?""",OH

19832,"I like to camp out. You won't take me back home again, Snake-eye, will you?""",OH

19833,"""Not right away,"" says I. ""We'll stay here in the cave a while.""",OH

19834,"""All right!"" says he. ""That'll be fine. I never had such fun in all my life.""",OH

19835,We went to bed about eleven o'clock. We spread down some wide blankets,OH

19836,and quilts and put Red Chief between us. We weren't afraid he'd run away. He,OH

19837,"kept us awake for three hours, jumping up and reaching for his rifle and",OH

19838,"screeching: ""Hist! pard,"" in mine and Bill's ears, as the fancied crackle of a",OH

19839,twig or the rustle of a leaf revealed to his young imagination the stealthy,OH

19840,"approach of the outlaw band. At last, I fell into a troubled sleep, and dreamed",OH

19841,that I had been kidnapped and chained to a tree by a ferocious pirate with red,OH

19842,hair.,OH

19843,"Just at daybreak, I was awakened by a series of awful screams from Bill. They",OH

19844,"weren't yells, or howls, or shouts, or whoops, or yawps, such as you'd expect",OH

19845,"from a manly set of vocal organs�they were simply indecent, terrifying,",OH

19846,"humiliating screams, such as women emit when they see ghosts or caterpillars.",OH

19847,"It's an awful thing to hear a strong, desperate, fat man scream incontinently in",OH

19848,a cave at daybreak.,OH

19849,"I jumped up to see what the matter was. Red Chief was sitting on Bill's chest,",OH

19850,with one hand twined in Bill's hair. In the other he had the sharp case-knife we,OH

19851,used for slicing bacon; and he was industriously and realistically trying to take,OH

19852,"Bill's scalp, according to the sentence that had been pronounced upon him the",OH

19853,evening before.,OH

19854,"I got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again. But, from that",OH

19855,"moment, Bill's spirit was broken. He laid down on his side of the bed, but he",OH

19856,never closed an eye again in sleep as long as that boy was with us. I dozed off,OH

19857,"for a while, but along toward sun-up I remembered that Red Chief had said I",OH

19858,was to be burned at the stake at the rising of the sun. I wasn't nervous or,OH

19859,afraid; but I sat up and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock.,OH

19860,"""What you getting up so soon for, Sam?"" asked Bill.",OH

19861,"""Me?"" says I. ""Oh, I got a kind of a pain in my shoulder. I thought sitting up",OH

19862,"would rest it.""",OH

19863,"""You're a liar!"" says Bill. ""You're afraid. You was to be burned at sunrise, and",OH

19864,"you was afraid he'd do it. And he would, too, if he could find a match. Ain't it",OH

19865,"awful, Sam? Do you think anybody will pay out money to get a little imp like",OH

19866,"that back home?""",OH

19867,"""Sure,"" said I. ""A rowdy kid like that is just the kind that parents dote on. Now,",OH

19869,"mountain and reconnoitre.""",OH

19870,I went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the,OH

19871,contiguous vicinity. Over toward Summit I expected to see the sturdy,OH

19872,yeomanry of the village armed with scythes and pitchforks beating the,OH

19873,countryside for the dastardly kidnappers. But what I saw was a peaceful,OH

19874,landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule. Nobody was,OH

19875,"dragging the creek; no couriers dashed hither and yon, bringing tidings of no",OH

19876,news to the distracted parents. There was a sylvan attitude of somnolent,OH

19877,sleepiness pervading that section of the external outward surface of Alabama,OH

19878,"that lay exposed to my view. ""Perhaps,"" says I to myself, ""it has not yet been",OH

19883,cocoanut.,OH

19884,"""He put a red-hot boiled potato down my back,"" explained Bill, ""and then",OH

19886,"Sam?""",OH

19887,"I took the rock away from the boy and kind of patched up the argument. ""I'll",OH

19888,"fix you,"" says the kid to Bill. ""No man ever yet struck the Red Chief but what",OH

19889,"he got paid for it. You better beware!""",OH

19890,After breakfast the kid takes a piece of leather with strings wrapped around it,OH

19891,out of his pocket and goes outside the cave unwinding it.,OH

19893,"do you, Sam?""",OH

19894,"""No fear of it,"" says I. ""He don't seem to be much of a home body. But we've",OH

19896,excitement around Summit on account of his disappearance; but maybe they,OH

19897,haven't realized yet that he's gone. His folks may think he's spending the night,OH

19898,"with Aunt Jane or one of the neighbours. Anyhow, he'll be missed to-day. Tonight we must get a message to his father demanding the two thousand dollars",OH

19899,"for his return.""",OH

19900,"Just then we heard a kind Of war-whoop, such as David might have emitted",OH

19902,"pulled out of his pocket, and he was whirling it around his head.",OH

19903,"I dodged, and heard a heavy thud and a kind of a sigh from Bill, like a horse",OH

19904,gives out when you take his saddle off. A niggerhead rock the size of an egg,OH

19905,had caught Bill just behind his left ear. He loosened himself all over and fell in,OH

19906,the fire across the frying pan of hot water for washing the dishes. I dragged,OH

20066,We took him home that night. We got him to go by telling him that his father,OH

20068,were going to hunt bears the next day.,OH

20069,It was just twelve o'clock when we knocked at Ebenezer's front door. Just at,OH

20070,the moment when I should have been abstracting the fifteen hundred dollars,OH

20071,"from the box under the tree, according to the original proposition, Bill was",OH

20072,counting out two hundred and fifty dollars into Dorset's hand.,OH

20073,When the kid found out we were going to leave him at home he started up a,OH

20074,howl like a calliope and fastened himself as tight as a leech to Bill's leg. His,OH

20075,"father peeled him away gradually, like a porous plaster.",OH

20076,"""How long can you hold him?"" asks Bill.",OH

20084,THE MARRY MONTH OF MAY,OH

20085,"Prithee, smite the poet in the eye when he would sing to you praises of the",OH

20086,month of May. It is a month presided over by the spirits of mischief and,OH

20087,madness. Pixies and flibbertigibbets haunt the budding woods: Puck and his,OH

20089,"In May nature holds up at us a chiding finger, bidding us remember that we",OH

20107,fact and the name deserve a sentence each. They have it.,OH

20108,When May poked Mr. Coulson he became elder brother to the turtle-dove. In,OH

20109,"the window near which he sat were boxes of jonquils, of hyacinths, geraniums",OH

20110,and pansies. The breeze brought their odour into the room. Immediately there,OH

20111,was a well-contested round between the breath of the flowers and the able and,OH

20112,active effluvium from gout liniment. The liniment won easily; but not before,OH

20113,the flowers got an uppercut to old Mr. Coulson's nose. The deadly work of the,OH

20114,"implacable, false enchantress May was done.",OH

20115,"Across the park to the olfactories of Mr. Coulson came other unmistakable,",OH

20117,"patchouli, orange peel, sewer gas, Albany grabs, Egyptian cigarettes, mortar",OH

20118,and the undried ink on newspapers. The inblowing air was sweet and mild.,OH

20160,consciously conscious.,OH

20161,"""That's just it,"" replied Miss Van Meeker Constantia Coulson, somewhat",OH

20163,"""I believe she said a week from to-day,"" said Mr. Coulson.",OH

20164,"Miss Van Meeker Constantia stood for a minute at the window gazing, toward",OH

20165,"the little park, flooded with the mellow afternoon sunlight. With the eye of a",OH

20166,botanist she viewed the flowers�most potent weapons of insidious May. With,OH

20167,the cool pulses of a virgin of Cologne she withstood the attack of the ethereal,OH

20168,"mildness. The arrows of the pleasant sunshine fell back, frostbitten, from the",OH

20169,cold panoply of her unthrilled bosom. The odour of the flowers waked no soft,OH

20170,sentiments in the unexplored recesses of her dormant heart. The chirp of the,OH

20171,sparrows gave her a pain. She mocked at May.,OH

20172,"But although Miss Coulson was proof against the season, she was keen",OH

20173,enough to estimate its power. She knew that elderly men and thick-waisted,OH

20174,"women jumped as educated fleas in the ridiculous train of May, the merry",OH

20175,mocker of the months. She had heard of foolish old gentlemen marrying their,OH

20176,"housekeepers before. What a humiliating thing, after all, was this feeling",OH

20177,called love!,OH

20178,"The next morning at 8 o'clock, when the iceman called, the cook told him that",OH

20179,Miss Coulson wanted to see him in the basement.,OH

20180,"""Well, ain't I the Olcott and Depew; not mentioning the first name at all?"" said",OH

20181,"the iceman, admiringly, of himself.",OH

20182,"As a concession he rolled his sleeves down, dropped his icehooks on a syringa",OH

20183,and went back. When Miss Van Meeker Constantia Coulson addressed him he,OH

20184,took off his hat.,OH

20185,"""There is a rear entrance to this basement,"" said Miss Coulson, ""which can be",OH

20186,"reached by driving into the vacant lot next door, where they are excavating for",OH

20199,"""Bring an axe,"" commanded Mr. Coulson, sardonically, ""or send out for a",OH

20200,"quart of prussic acid, or have a policeman come in and shoot me. I'd rather that",OH

20204,"""Do,"" said Mr. Coulson. ""They call this spring, do they? If it keeps up long I'll",OH

20206,Later Miss Coulson dutifully came in to inquire how the gout was progressing.,OH

20265,with reluctance.,OH

20266,Over in the Creek Nation was a family bearing the name of Tatum. I was told,OH

20269,"would follow. A younger generation of each family was growing up, and the",OH

20270,grass was keeping pace with them. But I gathered that they had fought fairly;,OH

20271,that they had not lain in cornfields and aimed at the division of their enemies',OH

20272,"suspenders in the back�partly, perhaps, because there were no cornfields, and",OH

20279,"confidence in each other, as all couples do who are and have or aren't and",OH

20280,"haven't. She was tolerably pretty, with a heavy mass of brown hair that helped",OH

20281,"her along. He introduced me to her, which seemed not to lessen her preference",OH

20282,for him; so I reasoned that they were surely soul-mates.,OH

20290,"There were active times on the ranch, just then, and Sam was too busy to go to",OH

20332,"""You're welcome, Sam.""",OH

20333,Simmons rolled a cigarette and stabbed his pony with both heels. Twenty,OH

20334,yards away he reined up and called back:,OH

20335,"""You don't want no�assistance, as you might say?""",OH

20336,"""Not any, thanks.""",OH

20337,"""I didn't think you would. Well, so long!""",OH

20338,Sam took out and opened a bone-handled pocket-knife and scraped a dried,OH

20339,piece of mud from his left boot. I thought at first he was going to swear a,OH

20340,"vendetta on the blade of it, or recite ""The Gipsy's Curse."" The few feuds I had",OH

20341,ever seen or read about usually opened that way. This one seemed to be,OH

20342,"presented with a new treatment. Thus offered on the stage, it would have been",OH

20343,"hissed off, and one of Belasco's thrilling melodramas demanded instead.",OH

20344,"""I wonder,"" said Sam, with a profoundly thoughtful expression, ""if the cook",OH

20345,"has any cold beans left over!""",OH

20346,"He called Wash, the Negro cook, and finding that he had some, ordered him to",OH

20347,heat up the pot and make some strong coffee. Then we went into Sam's private,OH

20348,"room, where he slept, and kept his armoury, dogs, and the saddles of his",OH

20349,favourite mounts. He took three or four six-shooters out of a bookcase and,OH

20350,"began to look them over, whistling ""The Cowboy's Lament"" abstractedly.",OH

20351,Afterward he ordered the two best horses on the ranch saddled and tied to the,OH

20352,hitching-post.,OH

20353,"Now, in the feud business, in all sections of the country, I have observed that",OH

20354,in one particular there is a delicate but strict etiquette belonging. You must not,OH

20355,mention the word or refer to the subject in the presence of a feudist. It would,OH

20356,be more reprehensible than commenting upon the mole on the chin of your,OH

20357,"rich aunt. I found, later on, that there is another unwritten rule, but I think that",OH

20358,belongs solely to the West.,OH

20359,It yet lacked two hours to supper-time; but in twenty minutes Sam and I were,OH

20360,"plunging deep into the reheated beans, hot coffee, and cold beef.",OH

20361,"""Nothing like a good meal before a long ride,"" said Sam. ""Eat hearty.""",OH

20362,I had a sudden suspicion.,OH

20363,"""Why did you have two horses saddled?"" I asked.",OH

20364,"""One, two�one, two,"" said Sam. ""You can count, can't you?""",OH

20365,His mathematics carried with it a momentary qualm and a lesson. The thought,OH

20366,had not occurred to him that the thought could possibly occur to me not to ride,OH

20367,at his side on that red road to revenge and justice. It was the higher calculus. I,OH

20368,was booked for the trail. I began to eat more beans.,OH

20369,In an hour we set forth at a steady gallop eastward. Our horses were,OH

20370,"Kentucky-bred, strengthened by the mesquite grass of the west. Ben Tatum's",OH

20371,"steeds may have been swifter, and he had a good lead; but if he had heard the",OH

20372,"punctual thuds of the hoofs of those trailers of ours, born in the heart of",OH

20373,"feudland, he might have felt that retribution was creeping up on the hoofprints of his dapper nags.",OH

20374,I knew that Ben Tatum's card to play was flight�flight until he came within,OH

20375,the safer territory of his own henchmen and supporters. He knew that the man,OH

20376,pursuing him would follow the trail to any end where it might lead.,OH

20377,"During the ride Sam talked of the prospect for rain, of the price of beef, and of",OH

20378,the musical glasses. You would have thought he had never had a brother or a,OH

20379,sweetheart or an enemy on earth. There are some subjects too big even for the,OH

20380,"words in the ""Unabridged."" Knowing this phase of the feud code, but not",OH

20381,"having practised it sufficiently, I overdid the thing by telling some slightly",OH

20382,funny anecdotes. Sam laughed at exactly the right place�laughed with his,OH

20383,"mouth. When I caught sight of his mouth, I wished I had been blessed with",OH

20384,enough sense of humour to have suppressed those anecdotes.,OH

20385,"Our first sight of them we had in Guthrie. Tired and hungry, we stumbled,",OH

20386,"unwashed, into a little yellow-pine hotel and sat at a table. In the opposite",OH

20387,"corner we saw the fugitives. They were bent upon their meal, but looked",OH

20388,around at times uneasily.,OH

20389,"The girl was dressed in brown�one of these smooth, half-shiny, silky-looking",OH

20390,"affairs with lace collar and cuffs, and what I believe they call an accordionplaited skirt. She wore a thick brown veil down to her nose, and a broadbrimmed straw hat with some kind of feathers adorning it. The man wore",OH

20391,"plain, dark clothes, and his hair was trimmed very short. He was such a man as",OH

20392,you might see anywhere.,OH

20393,There they were�the murderer and the woman he had stolen. There we were,OH

20394,"�the rightful avenger, according to the code, and the supernumerary who",OH

20395,writes these words.,OH

20396,"For one time, at least, in the heart of the supernumerary there rose the killing",OH

20397,instinct. For one moment he joined the force of combatants�orally.,OH

20398,"""What are you waiting for, Sam?"" I said in a whisper. ""Let him have it now!""",OH

20399,Sam gave a melancholy sigh.,OH

20400,"""You don't understand; but he does,"" he said. ""He knows. Mr. Tenderfoot,",OH

20401,there's a rule out here among white men in the Nation that you can't shoot a,OH

20402,man when he's with a woman. I never knew it to be broke yet. You can't do it.,OH

20403,"You've got to get him in a gang of men or by himself. That's why. He knows it,",OH

20404,"too. We all know. So, that's Mr. Ben Tatum! One of the 'pretty men'! I'll cut",OH

20405,"him out of the herd before they leave the hotel, and regulate his account!""",OH

20406,After supper the flying pair disappeared quickly. Although Sam haunted lobby,OH

20407,"and stairway and halls half the night, in some mysterious way the fugitives",OH

20408,eluded him; and in the morning the veiled lady in the brown dress with the,OH

20409,"accordion-plaited skirt and the dapper young man with the close-clipped hair,",OH

20410,"and the buckboard with the prancing nags, were gone.",OH

20411,"It is a monotonous story, that of the ride; so it shall be curtailed. Once again",OH

20412,we overtook them on a road. We were about fifty yards behind. They turned in,OH

20413,the buckboard and looked at us; then drove on without whipping up their,OH

20414,horses. Their safety no longer lay in speed. Ben Tatum knew. He knew that the,OH

20415,"only rock of safety left to him was the code. There is no doubt that, had he",OH

20416,"been alone, the matter would have been settled quickly with Sam Durkee in",OH

20417,the usual way; but he had something at his side that kept still the trigger-finger,OH

20418,of both. It seemed likely that he was no coward.,OH

20419,"So, you may perceive that woman, on occasions, may postpone instead of",OH

20420,precipitating conflict between man and man. But not willingly or consciously.,OH

20421,She is oblivious of codes.,OH

20422,"Five miles farther, we came upon the future great Western city of Chandler.",OH

20423,The horses of pursuers and pursued were starved and weary. There was one,OH

20424,hotel that offered danger to man and entertainment to beast; so the four of us,OH

20425,met again in the dining room at the ringing of a bell so resonant and large that,OH

20426,it had cracked the welkin long ago. The dining room was not as large as the,OH

20427,one at Guthrie.,OH

20428,Just as we were eating apple pie�how Ben Davises and tragedy impinge upon,OH

20429,each other!�I noticed Sam looking with keen intentness at our quarry where,OH

20430,they were seated at a table across the room. The girl still wore the brown dress,OH

20431,"with lace collar and cuffs, and the veil drawn down to her nose. The man bent",OH

20432,"over his plate, with his close cropped head held low.",OH

20433,"""There's a code,"" I heard Sam say, either to me or to himself, ""that won't let",OH

20434,"you shoot a man in the company of a woman; but, by thunder, there ain't one",OH

20435,"to keep you from killing a woman in the company of a man!""",OH

20436,"And, quicker than my mind could follow his argument, he whipped a Colt's",OH

20444,"technically, the obligations of the code.",OH

20445,XI,OH

20446,SUITE HOMES AND THEIR ROMANCE,OH

20447,Few young couples in the Big-City-of-Bluff began their married existence,OH

20448,with greater promise of happiness than did Mr. and Mrs. Claude Turpin. They,OH

20449,felt no especial animosity toward each other; they were comfortably,OH

20450,established in a handsome apartment house that had a name and,OH

20451,accommodations like those of a sleeping-car; they were living as expensively,OH

20452,as the couple on the next floor above who had twice their income; and their,OH

20453,"marriage had occurred on a wager, a ferry-boat and first acquaintance, thus",OH

20454,securing a sensational newspaper notice with their names attached to pictures,OH

20455,of the Queen of Roumania and M. Santos-Dumont.,OH

20456,"Turpin's income was $200 per month. On pay day, after calculating the",OH

20457,"amounts due for rent, instalments on furniture and piano, gas, and bills owed",OH

20458,"to the florist, confectioner, milliner, tailor, wine merchant and cab company,",OH

20459,the Turpins would find that they still had $200 left to spend. How to do this is,OH

20460,one of the secrets of metropolitan life.,OH

20461,The domestic life of the Turpins was a beautiful picture to see. But you,OH

20462,"couldn't gaze upon it as you could at an oleograph of ""Don't Wake Grandma,""",OH

20463,"or ""Brooklyn by Moonlight.""",OH

20464,You had to blink when looked at it; and you heard a fizzing sound just like the,OH

20465,"machine with a ""scope"" at the end of it. Yes; there wasn't much repose about",OH

20466,"the picture of the Turpins' domestic life. It was something like ""Spearing",OH

20467,"Salmon in the Columbia River,"" or ""Japanese Artillery in Action.""",OH

20468,Every day was just like another; as the days are in New York. In the morning,OH

20469,"Turpin would take bromo-seltzer, his pocket change from under the clock, his",OH

20470,"hat, no breakfast and his departure for the office. At noon Mrs. Turpin would",OH

20471,"get out of bed and humour, put on a kimono, airs, and the water to boil for",OH

20472,coffee.,OH

20473,Turpin lunched downtown. He came home at 6 to dress for dinner. They,OH

20474,"always dined out. They strayed from the chop-house to chop-sueydom, from",OH

20475,"terrace to table d'h�te, from rathskeller to roadhouse, from caf� to casino, from",OH

20476,Maria's to the Martha Washington. Such is domestic life in the great city. Your,OH

20477,vine is the mistletoe; your fig tree bears dates. Your household gods are,OH

20478,Mercury and John Howard Payne. For the wedding march you now hear only,OH

20479,"""Come with the Gypsy Bride."" You rarely dine at the same place twice in",OH

20480,"succession. You tire of the food; and, besides, you want to give them time for",OH

20481,the question of that souvenir silver sugar bowl to blow over.,OH

20482,The Turpins were therefore happy. They made many warm and delightful,OH

20483,"friends, some of whom they remembered the next day. Their home life was an",OH

20484,"ideal one, according to the rules and regulations of the Book of Bluff.",OH

20485,There came a time when it dawned upon Turpin that his wife was getting away,OH

20486,"with too much money. If you belong to the near-swell class in the Big City,",OH

20487,"and your income is $200 per month, and you find at the end of the month, after",OH

20488,"looking over the bills for current expenses, that you, yourself, have spent",OH

20489,"$150, you very naturally wonder what has become of the other $50. So you",OH

20490,suspect your wife. And perhaps you give her a hint that something needs,OH

20491,explanation.,OH

20492,"""I say, Vivien,"" said Turpin, one afternoon when they were enjoying in rapt",OH

20493,"silence the peace and quiet of their cozy apartment, ""you've been creating a",OH

20494,hiatus big enough for a dog to crawl through in this month's honorarium. You,OH

20495,"haven't been paying your dressmaker anything on account, have you?""",OH

20496,There was a moment's silence. No sounds could be heard except the breathing,OH

20497,"of the fox terrier, and the subdued, monotonous sizzling of Vivien's fulvous",OH

20498,"locks against the insensate curling irons. Claude Turpin, sitting upon a pillow",OH

20499,"that he had thoughtfully placed upon the convolutions of the apartment sofa,",OH

20500,"narrowly watched the riante, lovely face of his wife.",OH

20501,"""Claudie, dear,"" said she, touching her finger to her ruby tongue and testing",OH

20502,"the unresponsive curling irons, ""you do me an injustice. Mme. Toinette has not",OH

20503,"seen a cent of mine since the day you paid your tailor ten dollars on account.""",OH

20504,Turpin's suspicions were allayed for the time. But one day soon there came an,OH

20505,anonymous letter to him that read:,OH

20506,Watch your wife. She is blowing in your money secretly. I was a sufferer,OH

20507,"just as you are. The place is No. 345 Blank Street. A word to the wise, etc.",OH

20508,A MAN WHO KNOWS.,OH

20509,Turpin took this letter to the captain of police of the precinct that he lived in.,OH

20510,"""My precinct is as clean as a hound's tooth,"" said the captain. ""The lid's shut",OH

20511,down as close there as it is over the eye of a Williamsburg girl when she's,OH

20512,"kissed at a party. But if you think there's anything queer at the address, I'll go",OH

20513,"there with ye.""",OH

20514,"On the next afternoon at 3, Turpin and the captain crept softly up the stairs of",OH

20515,"No. 345 Blank Street. A dozen plain-clothes men, dressed in full police",OH

20516,"uniforms, so as to allay suspicion, waited in the hall below.",OH

20517,"At the top of the stairs was a door, which was found to be locked. The captain",OH

20518,took a key from his pocket and unlocked it. The two men entered.,OH

20519,"They found themselves in a large room, occupied by twenty or twenty-five",OH

20520,"elegantly clothed ladies. Racing charts hung against the walls, a ticker clicked",OH

20521,in one corner; with a telephone receiver to his ear a man was calling out the,OH

20522,various positions of the horses in a very exciting race. The occupants of the,OH

20523,"room looked up at the intruders; but, as if reassured by the sight of the",OH

20524,"captain's uniform, they reverted their attention to the man at the telephone.",OH

20525,"""You see,"" said the captain to Turpin, ""the value of an anonymous letter! No",OH

20526,high-minded and self-respecting gentleman should consider one worthy of,OH

20527,"notice. Is your wife among this assembly, Mr. Turpin?""",OH

20528,"""She is not,"" said Turpin.",OH

20529,"""And if she was,"" continued the captain, ""would she be within the reach of the",OH

20530,tongue of slander? These ladies constitute a Browning Society. They meet to,OH

20531,"discuss the meaning of the great poet. The telephone is connected with Boston,",OH

20532,whence the parent society transmits frequently its interpretations of the poems.,OH

20533,"Be ashamed of yer suspicions, Mr. Turpin.""",OH

20534,"""Go soak your shield,"" said Turpin. ""Vivien knows how to take care of herself",OH

20535,in a pool-room. She's not dropping anything on the ponies. There must be,OH

20536,"something queer going on here.""",OH

20537,"""Nothing but Browning,"" said the captain. ""Hear that?""",OH

20538,"""Thanatopsis by a nose,"" drawled the man at the telephone.",OH

20539,"""That's not Browning; that's Longfellow,"" said Turpin, who sometimes read",OH

20540,books.,OH

20541,"""Back to the pasture!"" exclaimed the captain. ""Longfellow made the pacingto-wagon record of 7.53 'way back in 1868.""",OH

20542,"""I believe there's something queer about this joint,"" repeated Turpin.",OH

20543,"""I don't see it,"" said the captain.",OH

20544,"""I know it looks like a pool-room, all right,"" persisted Turpin, ""but that's all a",OH

20545,blind. Vivien has been dropping a lot of coin somewhere. I believe there's,OH

20546,"some under-handed work going on here.""",OH

20547,"A number of racing sheets were tacked close together, covering a large space",OH

20548,"on one of the walls. Turpin, suspicious, tore several of them down. A door,",OH

20549,"previously hidden, was revealed. Turpin placed an ear to the crack and listened",OH

20550,"intently. He heard the soft hum of many voices, low and guarded laughter, and",OH

20551,"a sharp, metallic clicking and scraping as if from a multitude of tiny but busy",OH

20552,objects.,OH

20553,"""My God! It is as I feared!"" whispered Turpin to himself. ""Summon your men",OH

20554,"at once!"" he called to the captain. ""She is in there, I know.""",OH

20555,At the blowing of the captain's whistle the uniformed plain-clothes men rushed,OH

20556,up the stairs into the pool-room. When they saw the betting paraphernalia,OH

20557,"distributed around they halted, surprised and puzzled to know why they had",OH

20558,been summoned.,OH

20559,But the captain pointed to the locked door and bade them break it down. In a,OH

20560,few moments they demolished it with the axes they carried. Into the other,OH

20561,"room sprang Claude Turpin, with the captain at his heels.",OH

20562,The scene was one that lingered long in Turpin's mind. Nearly a score of,OH

20563,"women�women expensively and fashionably clothed, many beautiful and of",OH

20564,refined appearance�had been seated at little marble-topped tables. When the,OH

20565,police burst open the door they shrieked and ran here and there like gayly,OH

20566,plumed birds that had been disturbed in a tropical grove. Some became,OH

20567,hysterical; one or two fainted; several knelt at the feet of the officers and,OH

20568,besought them for mercy on account of their families and social position.,OH

20569,A man who had been seated behind a desk had seized a roll of currency as,OH

20570,large as the ankle of a Paradise Roof Gardens chorus girl and jumped out of,OH

20571,"the window. Half a dozen attendants huddled at one end of the room,",OH

20572,breathless from fear.,OH

20573,Upon the tables remained the damning and incontrovertible evidences of the,OH

20574,guilt of the habitu�es of that sinister room�dish after dish heaped high with,OH

20607,and then a bull-cart bearing Ransie Bilbro and his wife. The cart stopped at the,OH

20608,"Justice's door, and the two climbed down. Ransie was a narrow six feet of",OH

20609,sallow brown skin and yellow hair. The imperturbability of the mountains,OH

20610,"hung upon him like a suit of armour. The woman was calicoed, angled, snuffbrushed, and weary with unknown desires. Through it all gleamed a faint",OH

20611,protest of cheated youth unconscious of its loss.,OH

20612,"The Justice of the Peace slipped his feet into his shoes, for the sake of dignity,",OH

20632,The Justice of the Peace stirred deliberately to his duties. He placed his one,OH

20780,A SACRIFICE HIT,OH

20781,The editor of the Hearthstone Magazine has his own ideas about the selection,OH

20782,"of manuscript for his publication. His theory is no secret; in fact, he will",OH

20783,"expound it to you willingly sitting at his mahogany desk, smiling benignantly",OH

20784,and tapping his knee gently with his gold-rimmed eye-glasses.,OH

20785,"""The Hearthstone,"" he will say, ""does not employ a staff of readers. We obtain",OH

20786,opinions of the manuscripts submitted to us directly from types of the various,OH

20787,"classes of our readers.""",OH

20788,That is the editor's theory; and this is the way he carries it out:,OH

20789,When a batch of MSS. is received the editor stuffs every one of his pockets,OH

20790,full of them and distributes them as he goes about during the day. The office,OH

20791,"employees, the hall porter, the janitor, the elevator man, messenger boys, the",OH

20792,"waiters at the caf� where the editor has luncheon, the man at the news-stand",OH

20793,"where he buys his evening paper, the grocer and milkman, the guard on the",OH

20794,"5.30 uptown elevated train, the ticket-chopper at Sixty ����th street, the cook",OH

20795,and maid at his home�these are the readers who pass upon MSS. sent in to,OH

20796,the Hearthstone Magazine. If his pockets are not entirely emptied by the time,OH

20797,he reaches the bosom of his family the remaining ones are handed over to his,OH

20798,wife to read after the baby goes to sleep. A few days later the editor gathers in,OH

20799,the MSS. during his regular rounds and considers the verdict of his assorted,OH

20800,readers.,OH

20801,This system of making up a magazine has been very successful; and the,OH

20802,"circulation, paced by the advertising rates, is making a wonderful record of",OH

20803,speed.,OH

20804,"The Hearthstone Company also publishes books, and its imprint is to be found",OH

20805,"on several successful works�all recommended, says the editor, by the",OH

20806,Hearthstone's army of volunteer readers. Now and then (according to talkative,OH

20807,members of the editorial staff) theHearthstone has allowed manuscripts to slip,OH

20808,"through its fingers on the advice of its heterogeneous readers, that afterward",OH

20809,proved to be famous sellers when brought out by other houses.,OH

20810,"For instance (the gossips say), ""The Rise and Fall of Silas Latham"" was",OH

20811,unfavourably passed upon by the elevator-man; the office-boy unanimously,OH

20812,"rejected ""The Boss""; ""In the Bishop's Carriage"" was contemptuously looked",OH

20813,"upon by the street-car conductor; ""The Deliverance"" was turned down by a",OH

20820,coal (whose adverse decision lost to the Hearthstone Company the manuscript,OH

20821,"of ""The Under World""), has expectations of becoming editor of the magazine",OH

20822,some day.,OH

20823,This method of the Hearthstone was well known to Allen Slayton when he,OH

20824,"wrote his novelette entitled ""Love Is All."" Slayton had hung about the editorial",OH

20825,offices of all the magazines so persistently that he was acquainted with the,OH

20826,inner workings of every one in Gotham.,OH

20827,He knew not only that the editor of the Hearthstone handed his MSS. around,OH

20828,"among different types of people for reading, but that the stories of sentimental",OH

20829,"love-interest went to Miss Puffkin, the editor's stenographer. Another of the",OH

20830,editor's peculiar customs was to conceal invariably the name of the writer,OH

20831,from his readers of MSS. so that a glittering name might not influence the,OH

20832,sincerity of their reports.,OH

20833,"Slayton made ""Love Is All"" the effort of his life. He gave it six months of the",OH

20834,"best work of his heart and brain. It was a pure love-story, fine, elevated,",OH

20835,"romantic, passionate�a prose poem that set the divine blessing of love (I am",OH

20836,"transposing from the manuscript) high above all earthly gifts and honours, and",OH

20837,listed it in the catalogue of heaven's choicest rewards. Slayton's literary,OH

20838,ambition was intense. He would have sacrificed all other worldly possessions,OH

20839,to have gained fame in his chosen art. He would almost have cut off his right,OH

20840,"hand, or have offered himself to the knife of the appendicitis fancier to have",OH

20841,realized his dream of seeing one of his efforts published in the Hearthstone.,OH

20842,"Slayton finished ""Love Is All,"" and took it to the Hearthstone in person. The",OH

20843,"office of the magazine was in a large, conglomerate building, presided under",OH

20844,by a janitor.,OH

20845,As the writer stepped inside the door on his way to the elevator a potato,OH

20846,"masher flew through the hall, wrecking Slayton's hat, and smashing the glass",OH

20847,"of the door. Closely following in the wake of the utensil flew the janitor, a",OH

20848,"bulky, unwholesome man, suspenderless and sordid, panic-stricken and",OH

20849,"breathless. A frowsy, fat woman with flying hair followed the missile. The",OH

20850,"janitor's foot slipped on the tiled floor, he fell in a heap with an exclamation of",OH

20851,despair. The woman pounced upon him and seized his hair. The man bellowed,OH

20852,lustily.,OH

20853,"Her vengeance wreaked, the virago rose and stalked triumphant as Minerva,",OH

20854,"back to some cryptic domestic retreat at the rear. The janitor got to his feet,",OH

20855,blown and humiliated.,OH

20856,"""This is married life,"" he said to Slayton, with a certain bruised humour.",OH

20857,"""That's the girl I used to lay awake of nights thinking about. Sorry about your",OH

20859,"lose me job.""",OH

20860,Slayton took the elevator at the end of the hall and went up to the offices of the,OH

20862,give him an answer as to its availability at the end of a week.,OH

20863,Slayton formulated his great winning scheme on his way down. It struck him,OH

20864,"with one brilliant flash, and he could not refrain from admiring his own genius",OH

20865,in conceiving the idea. That very night he set about carrying it into execution.,OH

20866,"Miss Puffkin, the Hearthstone stenographer, boarded in the same house with",OH

20868,and Slayton had been introduced to her some time before.,OH

20869,The writer's daring and self-sacrificing project was this: He knew that the,OH

20870,editor of the Hearthstone relied strongly upon Miss Puffkin's judgment in the,OH

20871,manuscript of romantic and sentimental fiction. Her taste represented the,OH

20872,immense average of mediocre women who devour novels and stories of that,OH

20873,"type. The central idea and keynote of ""Love Is All"" was love at first sight�the",OH

20874,"enrapturing,",OH

20875,"irresistible, soul-thrilling feeling that compels a man or a woman to recognize",OH

20876,his or her spirit-mate as soon as heart speaks to heart. Suppose he should,OH

20877,impress this divine truth upon Miss Puffkin personally!�would she not surely,OH

20878,indorse her new and rapturous sensations by recommending highly to the,OH

20879,"editor of the Hearthstone the novelette ""Love Is All""?",OH

20880,Slayton thought so. And that night he took Miss Puffkin to the theatre. The,OH

20881,"next night he made vehement love to her in the dim parlour of the boardinghouse. He quoted freely from ""Love Is All""; and he wound up with Miss",OH

20882,"Puffkin's head on his shoulder, and visions of literary fame dancing in his",OH

20883,head.,OH

20884,"But Slayton did not stop at love-making. This, he said to himself, was the",OH

20885,"turning point of his life; and, like a true sportsman, he ""went the limit."" On",OH

20886,Thursday night he and Miss Puffkin walked over to the Big Church in the,OH

20887,Middle of the Block and were married.,OH

20888,"Brave Slayton! Ch�teaubriand died in a garret, Byron courted a widow, Keats",OH

20889,"starved to death, Poe mixed his drinks, De Quincey hit the pipe, Ade lived in",OH

20890,"Chicago, James kept on doing it, Dickens wore white socks, De Maupassant",OH

20891,"wore a strait-jacket, Tom Watson became a Populist, Jeremiah wept, all these",OH

20894,On Friday morning Mrs. Slayton said she would go over to the Hearthstone,OH

20896,and resign her position as stenographer.,OH

20897,"""Was there anything�er�that�er�you particularly fancied in the stories",OH

20900,"read anything in years that I thought was half as nice and true to life.""",OH

20901,That afternoon Slayton hurried down to the Hearthstone office. He felt that his,OH

20903,reputation would soon be his.,OH

20904,The office boy met him at the railing in the outer office. It was not for,OH

20905,unsuccessful authors to hold personal colloquy with the editor except at rare,OH

20906,intervals.,OH

20907,"Slayton, hugging himself internally, was nursing in his heart the exquisite",OH

20908,hope of being able to crush the office boy with his forthcoming success.,OH

20909,He inquired concerning his novelette. The office boy went into the sacred,OH

20910,"precincts and brought forth a large envelope, thick with more than the bulk of",OH

20911,a thousand checks.,OH

20912,"""The boss told me to tell you he's sorry,"" said the boy, ""but your manuscript",OH

20916,"that she had been asked to read?""",OH

20917,"""Sure she did,"" answered the office boy wisely. ""I heard the old man say that",OH

20918,"Miss Puffkin said it was a daisy. The name of it was, 'Married for the Mazuma,",OH

20919,"or a Working Girl's Triumph.'""",OH

20920,"""Say, you!"" said the office boy confidentially, ""your name's Slayton, ain't it? I",OH

20929,"Twenty miles west of Tucson, the ""Sunset Express"" stopped at a tank to take",OH

20931,acquired some other things that were not good for it.,OH

20932,"While the fireman was lowering the feeding hose, Bob Tidball, ""Shark""",OH

20933,Dodson and a quarter-bred Creek Indian called John Big Dog climbed on the,OH

20934,engine and showed the engineer three round orifices in pieces of ordnance that,OH

20935,they carried. These orifices so impressed the engineer with their possibilities,OH

20936,"that he raised both hands in a gesture such as accompanies the ejaculation ""Do",OH

20937,"tell!""",OH

20938,"At the crisp command of Shark Dodson, who was leader of the attacking force",OH

20939,the engineer descended to the ground and uncoupled the engine and tender.,OH

20940,"Then John Big Dog, perched upon the coal, sportively held two guns upon the",OH

20943,"Shark Dodson and Bob Tidball, scorning to put such low-grade ore as the",OH

20944,"passengers through the mill, struck out for the rich pocket of the express car.",OH

20945,"They found the messenger serene in the belief that the ""Sunset Express"" was",OH

20946,taking on nothing more stimulating and dangerous than aqua pura. While Bob,OH

20947,was knocking this idea out of his head with the butt-end of his six-shooter,OH

20948,Shark Dodson was already dosing the express-car safe with dynamite.,OH

20949,"The safe exploded to the tune of $30,000, all gold and currency. The",OH

20950,passengers thrust their heads casually out of the windows to look for the,OH

20951,"thunder-cloud. The conductor jerked at the bell-rope, which sagged down",OH

20952,"loose and unresisting, at his tug. Shark Dodson and Bob Tidball, with their",OH

20953,"booty in a stout canvas bag, tumbled out of the express car and ran awkwardly",OH

20955,"The engineer, sullenly angry but wise, ran the engine, according to orders,",OH

20956,rapidly away from the inert train. But before this was accomplished the,OH

20957,"express messenger, recovered from Bob Tidball's persuader to neutrality,",OH

20958,jumped out of his car with a Winchester rifle and took a trick in the game. Mr.,OH

20959,"John Big Dog, sitting on the coal tender, unwittingly made a wrong lead by",OH

20960,"giving an imitation of a target, and the messenger trumped him. With a ball",OH

20963,Two miles from the tank the engineer was ordered to stop.,OH

20964,The robbers waved a defiant adieu and plunged down the steep slope into the,OH

20965,thick woods that lined the track. Five minutes of crashing through a thicket of,OH

20966,"chaparral brought them to open woods, where three horses were tied to lowhanging branches. One was waiting for John Big Dog, who would never ride",OH

20967,by night or day again. This animal the robbers divested of saddle and bridle,OH

20968,"and set free. They mounted the other two with the bag across one pommel, and",OH

20969,"rode fast and with discretion through the forest and up a primeval, lonely",OH

20970,gorge. Here the animal that bore Bob Tidball slipped on a mossy boulder and,OH

20971,broke a foreleg. They shot him through the head at once and sat down to hold,OH

20972,a council of flight. Made secure for the present by the tortuous trail they had,OH

20973,"travelled, the question of time was no longer so big. Many miles and hours lay",OH

20974,"between them and the spryest posse that could follow. Shark Dodson's horse,",OH

20975,"with trailing rope and dropped bridle, panted and cropped thankfully of the",OH

20977,double handfuls of the neat packages of currency and the one sack of gold and,OH

20978,chuckled with the glee of a child.,OH

20979,"""Say, you old double-decked pirate,"" he called joyfully to Dodson, ""you said",OH

20988,"""It's short of what I expected,"" said Shark Dodson, kicking softly at the",OH

21005,night I run into the camp of a Wild West show that was travellin' among the,OH

21008,"""Oh, I reckon you'd have ended up about the same,"" said Bob Tidball,",OH

21010,"makes us turn out the way we do.""",OH

21016,"we, Shark? I'll bag this boodle ag'in and we'll hit the trail for higher timber.""",OH

21017,Bob Tidball replaced the spoil in the bag and tied the mouth of it tightly with a,OH

21071,"brick, was set flush with the street�the main street of the town of Bethel.",OH

21072,Bethel rested upon the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge. Above it the mountains,OH

21073,were piled to the sky. Far below it the turbid Catawba gleamed yellow along,OH

21074,its disconsolate valley.,OH

21075,The June day was at its sultriest hour. Bethel dozed in the tepid shade. Trade,OH

21077,"clicking of the chips in the grand-jury room, where the ""court-house gang""",OH

21078,was playing poker. From the open back door of the office a well-worn path,OH

21079,meandered across the grassy lot to the court-house. The treading out of that,OH

21080,path had cost Goree all he ever had�first inheritance of a few thousand,OH

21081,"dollars, next the old family home, and, latterly the last shreds of his selfrespect and manhood. The ""gang"" had cleaned him out. The broken gambler",OH

21082,had turned drunkard and parasite; he had lived to see this day come when the,OH

21083,men who had stripped him denied him a seat at the game. His word was no,OH

21084,"longer to be taken. The daily bouts at cards had arranged itself accordingly,",OH

21086,"county clerk, a sportive deputy, a gay attorney, and a chalk-faced man hailing",OH

21109,"chance�he was saying to himself�if he had one more stake at the game, he",OH

21110,"thought he could win; but he had nothing left to sell, and his credit was more",OH

21111,than exhausted.,OH

21141,"corner, a new lock to his rifle; and, leading Martella to a certain spot on the",OH

21142,"mountain-side, he pointed out to her how a small cannon�doubtless a thing",OH

21143,not beyond the scope of their fortune in price�might be planted so as to,OH

21144,"command and defend the sole accessible trail to the cabin, to the confusion of",OH

21145,revenues and meddling strangers forever.,OH

21146,But Adam reckoned without his Eve. These things represented to him the,OH

21147,"applied power of wealth, but there slumbered in his dingy cabin an ambition",OH

21148,that soared far above his primitive wants. Somewhere in Mrs. Garvey's bosom,OH

21149,still survived a spot of femininity unstarved by twenty years of Blackjack. For,OH

21150,so long a time the sounds in her ears had been the scaly-barks dropping in the,OH

21151,"woods at noon, and the wolves singing among the rocks at night, and it was",OH

21152,enough to have purged her of vanities. She had grown fat and sad and yellow,OH

21153,"and dull. But when the means came, she felt a rekindled desire to assume the",OH

21154,perquisites of her sex�to sit at tea tables; to buy futile things; to whitewash,OH

21155,the hideous veracity of life with a little form and ceremony. So she coldly,OH

21156,"vetoed Pike's proposed system of fortifications, and announced that they",OH

21157,"would descend upon the world, and gyrate socially.",OH

21158,"And thus, at length, it was decided, and the thing done. The village of Laurel",OH

21159,was their compromise between Mrs. Garvey's preference for one of the large,OH

21160,valley towns and Pike's hankering for primeval solitudes. Laurel yielded a,OH

21161,halting round of feeble social distractions comportable with Martella's,OH

21162,"ambitions, and was not entirely without recommendation to Pike, its contiguity",OH

21163,to the mountains presenting advantages for sudden retreat in case fashionable,OH

21164,society should make it advisable.,OH

21165,Their descent upon Laurel had been coincident with Yancey Goree's feverish,OH

21166,"desire to convert property into cash, and they bought the old Goree homestead,",OH

21167,paying four thousand dollars ready money into the spendthrift's shaking hands.,OH

21168,Thus it happened that while the disreputable last of the Gorees sprawled in his,OH

21169,"disreputable office, at the end of his row, spurned by the cronies whom he had",OH

21170,"gorged, strangers dwelt in the halls of his fathers.",OH

21171,"A cloud of dust was rolling, slowly up the parched street, with something",OH

21172,"travelling in the midst of it. A little breeze wafted the cloud to one side, and a",OH

21173,"new, brightly painted carryall, drawn by a slothful gray horse, became visible.",OH

21174,"The vehicle deflected from the middle of the street as it neared Goree's office,",OH

21175,and stopped in the gutter directly in front of his door.,OH

21176,"On the front seat sat a gaunt, tall man, dressed in black broadcloth, his rigid",OH

21177,hands incarcerated in yellow kid gloves. On the back seat was a lady who,OH

21178,triumphed over the June heat. Her stout form was armoured in a skin-tight silk,OH

21179,"dress of the description known as ""changeable,"" being a gorgeous combination",OH

21180,"of shifting hues. She sat erect, waving a much-ornamented fan, with her eyes",OH

21181,fixed stonily far down the street. However Martella Garvey's heart might be,OH

21182,"rejoicing at the pleasures of her new life, Blackjack had done his work with",OH

21183,her exterior. He had carved her countenance to the image of emptiness and,OH

21184,"inanity; had imbued her with the stolidity of his crags, and the reserve of his",OH

21185,"hushed interiors. She always seemed to hear, whatever her surroundings were,",OH

21186,the scaly-barks falling and pattering down the mountain-side. She could,OH

21187,always hear the awful silence of Blackjack sounding through the stillest of,OH

21188,nights.,OH

21189,"Goree watched this solemn equipage, as it drove to his door, with only faint",OH

21190,"interest; but when the lank driver wrapped the reins about his whip,",OH

21191,"awkwardly descended, and stepped into the office, he rose unsteadily to",OH

21192,"receive him, recognizing Pike Garvey, the new, the transformed, the recently",OH

21193,civilized.,OH

21194,The mountaineer took the chair Goree offered him. They who cast doubts,OH

21195,upon Garvey's soundness of mind had a strong witness in the man's,OH

21196,"countenance. His face was too long, a dull saffron in hue, and immobile as a",OH

21197,"statue's. Pale-blue, unwinking round eyes without lashes added to the",OH

21198,singularity of his gruesome visage. Goree was at a loss to account for the visit.,OH

21199,"""Everything all right at Laurel, Mr. Garvey?"" he inquired.",OH

21200,"""Everything all right, sir, and mighty pleased is Missis Garvey and me with the",OH

21201,"property. Missis Garvey likes yo' old place, and she likes the neighbourhood.",OH

21211,"mistaken about that. I reckon you are mistaken about that. I sold out to you, as",OH

21222,"""Out with it,"" said Goree, his racked nerves growing impatient.",OH

21223,"Garvey threw his slouch hat upon the table, and leaned forward, fixing his",OH

21224,unblinking eyes upon Goree's.,OH

21226,"Coltranes.""",OH

21227,Goree frowned ominously. To speak of his feud to a feudist is a serious breach,OH

21228,"of the mountain etiquette. The man from ""back yan'"" knew it as well as the",OH

21229,lawyer did.,OH

21230,"""Na offense,"" he went on ""but purely in the way of business. Missis Garvey",OH

21231,hev studied all about feuds. Most of the quality folks in the mountains hev,OH

21247,"The little roll of currency on the table slowly untwisted itself, writhing and",OH

21248,jumping as its folds relaxed. In the silence that followed Garvey's last speech,OH

21249,the rattling of the poker chips in the court-house could be plainly heard. Goree,OH

21250,"knew that the sheriff had just won a pot, for the subdued whoop with which he",OH

21251,always greeted a victory floated across the square upon the crinkly heat waves.,OH

21252,"Beads of moisture stood on Goree's brow. Stooping, he drew the wickercovered demijohn from under the table, and filled a tumbler from it.",OH

21253,"""A little corn liquor, Mr. Garvey? Of course you are joking about�what you",OH

21254,"spoke of? Opens quite a new market, doesn't it? Feuds. Prime, two-fifty to",OH

21259,without a tremor of the lids of his staring eyes. The lawyer applauded the feat,OH

21260,"by a look of envious admiration. He poured his own drink, and took it like a",OH

21262,"""Two hundred,"" repeated Garvey. ""Thar's the money.""",OH

21263,A sudden passion flared up in Goree's brain. He struck the table with his fist.,OH

21268,"""It's fa'r and squar',"" said the squirrel hunter, but he reached out his hand as if",OH

21269,to take back the money; and then Goree knew that his own flurry of rage had,OH

21270,"not been from pride or resentment, but from anger at himself, knowing that he",OH

21271,would set foot in the deeper depths that were being opened to him. He turned,OH

21272,in an instant from an outraged gentleman to an anxious chafferer,OH

21273,recommending his goods.,OH

21274,"""Don't be in a hurry, Garvey,"" he said, his face crimson and his speech thick. ""I",OH

21275,"accept your p-p-proposition, though it's dirt cheap at two hundred. A t-trade's",OH

21280,"Goree, you bein' a lawyer, to show we traded.""",OH

21281,Goree seized a sheet of paper and a pen. The money was clutched in his moist,OH

21290,"other side of the street.""",OH

21291,The mountaineer crooked his long frame to look through the window in the,OH

21293,"gentleman of about fifty, wearing the inevitable long, double-breasted frock",OH

21294,"coat of the Southern lawmaker, and an old high silk hat, was passing on the",OH

21295,"opposite sidewalk. As Garvey looked, Goree glanced at his face. If there be",OH

21296,"such a thing as a yellow wolf, here was its counterpart. Garvey snarled as his",OH

21297,"unhuman eyes followed the moving figure, disclosing long, amber-coloured",OH

21298,fangs.,OH

21299,"""Is that him? Why, that's the man who sent me to the pen'tentiary once!""",OH

21304,"Mr. Goree, better'n you ever did!""",OH

21305,"He moved toward the door, but lingered there, betraying a slight perplexity.",OH

21306,"""Anything else to-day?"" inquired Goree with frothy sarcasm. ""Any family",OH

21323,money that had fallen from his hand to the floor. As the vehicle slowly turned,OH

21324,"about, the sheep, with a coat of newly grown wool, was hurrying, in indecent",OH

21325,"haste, along the path to the court-house.",OH

21342,"soon pouring upon the mottled red of his flesh a searching, white, summer",OH

21344,"his face from the window. His movement dislodged a heavy law book, which",OH

21345,"crashed upon the floor. Opening his eyes, he saw, bending over him, a man in",OH

21346,"a black frock coat. Looking higher, he discovered a well-worn silk hat, and",OH

21347,"beneath it the kindly, smooth face of Colonel Abner Coltrane.",OH

21348,"A little uncertain of the outcome, the colonel waited for the other to make",OH

21359,"bubbling of the falling stream. Coltrane brought a pitcher of the cool water,",OH

21387,"persistently and reasonably, reminding him of the simple mountain pleasures",OH

21388,"of which he had once been so fond, and insisting upon the genuineness of the",OH

21393,for this purpose�a series of slides and chutes upon which he had justly prided,OH

21394,"himself. In an instant the poor fellow, delighted at the idea of his being of use",OH

21398,"toward the mountains. His mind was yet strangely clogged, and his thoughts",OH

21399,"and memories were returning to his brain one by one, like carrier pigeons over",OH

21400,a stormy sea. But Coltrane was satisfied with the progress he had made.,OH

21405,"and combed himself to a more decent figure, but he was unsteady in the",OH

21406,"saddle, and he seemed to be deep in the contemplation of some vexing",OH

21407,"problem. Coltrane left him in his mood, relying upon the influence of changed",OH

21408,surroundings to restore his equilibrium.,OH

21409,"Once Goree was seized with a shaking fit, and almost came to a collapse. He",OH

21410,"had to dismount and rest at the side of the road. The colonel, foreseeing such a",OH

21411,"condition, had provided a small flask of whisky for the journey but when it",OH

21412,"was offered to him Goree refused it almost with violence, declaring he would",OH

21413,"never touch it again. By and by he was recovered, and went quietly enough for",OH

21414,"a mile or two. Then he pulled up his horse suddenly, and said:",OH

21415,"""I lost two hundred dollars last night, playing poker. Now, where did I get that",OH

21416,"money?""",OH

21417,"""Take it easy, Yancey. The mountain air will soon clear it up. We'll go fishing,",OH

21418,"first thing, at the Pinnacle Falls. The trout are jumping there like bullfrogs.",OH

21419,"We'll take Stella and Lucy along, and have a picnic on Eagle Rock. Have you",OH

21420,"forgotten how a hickory-cured-ham sandwich tastes, Yancey, to a hungry",OH

21421,"fisherman?""",OH

21422,Evidently the colonel did not believe the story of his lost wealth; so Goree,OH

21423,retired again into brooding silence.,OH

21424,By late Afternoon they had travelled ten of the twelve miles between Bethel,OH

21425,and Laurel. Half a mile this side of Laurel lay the old Goree place; a mile or,OH

21426,two beyond the village lived the Coltranes. The road was now steep and,OH

21427,"laborious, but the compensations were many. The tilted aisles of the forest",OH

21428,were opulent with leaf and bird and bloom. The tonic air put to shame the,OH

21429,"pharmacop�ia. The glades were dark with mossy shade, and bright with shy",OH

21430,"rivulets winking from the ferns and laurels. On the lower side they viewed,",OH

21431,"framed in the near foliage, exquisite sketches of the far valley swooning in its",OH

21432,opal haze.,OH

21433,Coltrane was pleased to see that his companion was yielding to the spell of the,OH

21434,hills and woods. For now they had but to skirt the base of Painter's Cliff; to,OH

21435,"cross Elder Branch and mount the hill beyond, and Goree would have to face",OH

21436,"the squandered home of his fathers. Every rock he passed, every tree, every",OH

21437,"foot of the rocky way, was familiar to him. Though he had forgotten the",OH

21438,"woods, they thrilled him like the music of ""Home, Sweet Home.""",OH

21439,"They rounded the cliff, descended into Elder Branch, and paused there to let",OH

21440,the horses drink and splash in the swift water. On the right was a rail fence that,OH

21441,"cornered there, and followed the road and stream. Inclosed by it was the old",OH

21442,apple orchard of the home place; the house was yet concealed by the brow of,OH

21443,"the steep hill. Inside and along the fence, pokeberries, elders, sassafras, and",OH

21444,"sumac grew high and dense. At a rustle of their branches, both Goree and",OH

21445,"Coltrane glanced up, and saw a long, yellow, wolfish face above the fence,",OH

21446,"staring at them with pale, unwinking eyes. The head quickly disappeared;",OH

21447,"there was a violent swaying of the bushes, and an ungainly figure ran up",OH

21448,"through the apple orchard in the direction of the house, zig-zagging among the",OH

21449,trees.,OH

21450,"""That's Garvey,"" said Coltrane; ""the man you sold out to. There's no doubt but",OH

21451,"he's considerably cracked. I had to send him up for moonshining once, several",OH

21452,"years ago, in spite of the fact that I believed him irresponsible. Why, what's the",OH

21453,"matter, Yancey?""",OH

21454,"Goree was wiping his forehead, and his face had lost its colour. ""Do I look",OH

21455,"queer, too?"" he asked, trying to smile. ""I'm just remembering a few more",OH

21456,"things."" Some of the alcohol had evaporated from his brain. ""I recollect now",OH

21457,"where I got that two hundred dollars.""",OH

21458,"""Don't think of it,"" said Coltrane cheerfully. ""Later on we'll figure it all out",OH

21459,"together.""",OH

21460,"They rode out of the branch, and when they reached the foot of the hill Goree",OH

21461,stopped again.,OH

21462,"""Did you ever suspect I was a very vain kind of fellow, Colonel?"" he asked.",OH

21463,"""Sort of foolish proud about appearances?""",OH

21464,"The colonel's eyes refused to wander to the soiled, sagging suit of flax and the",OH

21465,faded slouch hat.,OH

21466,"""It seems to me,"" he replied, mystified, but humouring him, ""I remember a",OH

21467,"young buck about twenty, with the tightest coat, the sleekest hair, and the",OH

21468,"prancingest saddle horse in the Blue Ridge.""",OH

21469,"""Right you are,"" said Goree eagerly. ""And it's in me yet, though it don't show.",OH

21470,"Oh, I'm as vain as a turkey gobbler, and as proud as Lucifer. I'm going to ask",OH

21471,"you to indulge this weakness of mine in a little matter.""",OH

21472,"""Speak out, Yancey. We'll create you Duke of Laurel and Baron of Blue Ridge,",OH

21473,if you choose; and you shall have a feather out of Stella's peacock's tail to,OH

21474,"wear in your hat.""",OH

21475,"""I'm in earnest. In a few minutes we'll pass the house up there on the hill",OH

21476,"where I was born, and where my people have lived for nearly a century.",OH

21477,Strangers live there now�and look at me! I am about to show myself to them,OH

21478,"ragged and poverty-stricken, a wastrel and a beggar. Colonel Coltrane, I'm",OH

21479,ashamed to do it. I want you to let me wear your coat and hat until we are out,OH

21480,"of sight beyond. I know you think it a foolish pride, but I want to make as",OH

21481,"good a showing as I can when I pass the old place.""",OH

21482,"""Now, what does this mean?"" said Coltrane to himself, as he compared his",OH

21483,companion's sane looks and quiet demeanour with his strange request. But he,OH

21484,"was already unbuttoning the coat, assenting readily, as if the fancy were in no",OH

21485,wise to be considered strange.,OH

21486,The coat and hat fitted Goree well. He buttoned the former about him with a,OH

21487,look of satisfaction and dignity. He and Coltrane were nearly the same size�,OH

21488,"rather tall, portly, and erect. Twenty-five years were between them, but in",OH

21489,appearance they might have been brothers. Goree looked older than his age;,OH

21490,"his face was puffy and lined; the colonel had the smooth, fresh complexion of",OH

21491,a temperate liver. He put on Goree's disreputable old flax coat and faded,OH

21492,slouch hat.,OH

21493,"""Now,"" said Goree, taking up the reins, ""I'm all right. I want you to ride about",OH

21494,"ten feet in the rear as we go by, Colonel, so that they can get a good look at",OH

21495,"me. They'll see I'm no back number yet, by any means. I guess I'll show up",OH

21496,"pretty well to them once more, anyhow. Let's ride on.""",OH

21497,"He set out up the hill at a smart trot, the colonel following, as he had been",OH

21498,requested.,OH

21499,"Goree sat straight in the saddle, with head erect, but his eyes were turned to",OH

21500,"the right, sharply scanning every shrub and fence and hiding-place in the old",OH

21501,"homestead yard. Once he muttered to himself, ""Will the crazy fool try it, or did",OH

21502,"I dream half of it?""",OH

21503,It was when he came opposite the little family burying ground that he saw,OH

21504,"what he had been looking for�a puff of white smoke, coming from the thick",OH

21505,cedars in one corner. He toppled so slowly to the left that Coltrane had time to,OH

21506,"urge his horse to that side, and catch him with one arm.",OH

21507,The squirrel hunter had not overpraised his aim. He had sent the bullet where,OH

21508,"he intended, and where Goree had expected that it would pass�through the",OH

21509,breast of Colonel Abner Coltrane's black frock coat.,OH

21510,"Goree leaned heavily against Coltrane, but he did not fall. The horses kept",OH

21511,"pace, side by side, and the Colonel's arm kept him steady. The little white",OH

21512,"houses of Laurel shone through the trees, half a mile away. Goree reached out",OH

21513,"one hand and groped until it rested upon Coltrane's fingers, which held his",OH

21514,bridle.,OH

21515,"""Good friend,"" he said, and that was all.",OH

21516,"Thus did Yancey Goree, as he rode past his old home, make, considering all",OH

21517,"things, the best showing that was in his power.",OH

21518,XVI,OH

21519,THE SONG AND THE SERGEANT,OH

21520,Half a dozen people supping at a table in one of the upper-Broadway all-night,OH

21521,restaurants were making too much noise. Three times the manager walked past,OH

21522,them with a politely warning glance; but their argument had waxed too warm,OH

21523,"to be quelled by a manager's gaze. It was midnight, and the restaurant was",OH

21524,filled with patrons from the theatres of that district. Some among the dispersed,OH

21525,audiences must have recognized among the quarrelsome sextet the faces of the,OH

21526,players belonging to the Carroll Comedy Company.,OH

21527,Four of the six made up the company. Another was the author of the,OH

21528,"comedietta, ""A Gay Coquette,"" which the quartette of players had been",OH

21529,presenting with fair success at several vaudeville houses in the city. The sixth,OH

21530,"at the table was a person inconsequent in the realm of art, but one at whose",OH

21531,bidding many lobsters had perished.,OH

21532,Loudly the six maintained their clamorous debate. No one of the Party was,OH

21533,silent except when answers were stormed from him by the excited ones. That,OH

21534,"was the comedian of ""A Gay Coquette."" He was a young man with a face even",OH

21535,too melancholy for his profession.,OH

21536,The oral warfare of four immoderate tongues was directed at Miss Clarice,OH

21537,"Carroll, the twinkling star of the small aggregation. Excepting the downcast",OH

21538,"comedian, all members of the party united in casting upon her with vehemence",OH

21539,"the blame of some momentous misfortune. Fifty times they told her: ""It is your",OH

21540,"fault, Clarice�it is you alone who spoilt the scene. It is only of late that you",OH

21541,"have acted this way. At this rate the sketch will have to be taken off.""",OH

21542,Miss Carroll was a match for any four. Gallic ancestry gave her a vivacity that,OH

21543,could easily mount to fury. Her large eyes flashed a scorching denial at her,OH

21544,"accusers. Her slender, eloquent arms constantly menaced the tableware. Her",OH

21545,"high, clear soprano voice rose to what would have been a scream had it not",OH

21546,possessed so pure a musical quality. She hurled back at the attacking four their,OH

21547,"denunciations in tones sweet, but of too great carrying power for a Broadway",OH

21548,restaurant.,OH

21549,Finally they exhausted her patience both as a woman and an artist. She sprang,OH

21550,"up like a panther, managed to smash half a dozen plates and glasses with one",OH

21551,"royal sweep of her arm, and defied her critics. They rose and wrangled more",OH

21552,loudly. The comedian sighed and looked a trifle sadder and disinterested. The,OH

21553,manager came tripping and suggested peace. He was told to go to the popular,OH

21554,synonym for war so promptly that the affair might have happened at The,OH

21555,Hague.,OH

21556,Thus was the manager angered. He made a sign with his hand and a waiter,OH

21557,slipped out of the door. In twenty minutes the party of six was in a police,OH

21558,station facing a grizzled and philosophical desk sergeant.,OH

21559,"""Disorderly conduct in a restaurant,"" said the policeman who had brought the",OH

21560,party in.,OH

21561,"The author of ""A Gay Coquette"" stepped to the front. He wore nose-glasses",OH

21562,"and evening clothes, even if his shoes had been tans before they met the",OH

21563,patent-leather-polish bottle.,OH

21564,"""Mr. Sergeant,"" said he, out of his throat, like Actor Irving, ""I would like to",OH

21565,protest against this arrest. The company of actors who are performing in a,OH

21566,"little play that I have written, in company with a friend and myself were",OH

21567,having a little supper. We became deeply interested in the discussion as to,OH

21568,which one of the cast is responsible for a scene in the sketch that lately has,OH

21569,fallen so flat that the piece is about to become a failure. We may have been,OH

21570,rather noisy and intolerant of interruption by the restaurant people; but the,OH

21571,matter was of considerable importance to all of us. You see that we are sober,OH

21572,and are not the kind of people who desire to raise disturbances. I hope that the,OH

21573,"case will not be pressed and that we may be allowed to go.""",OH

21574,"""Who makes the charge?"" asked the sergeant.",OH

21575,"""Me,"" said a white-aproned voice in the rear. ""De restaurant sent me to. De",OH

21576,"gang was raisin' a rough-house and breakin' dishes.""",OH

21577,"""The dishes were paid for,"" said the playwright. ""They were not broken",OH

21578,"purposely. In her anger, because we remonstrated with her for spoiling the",OH

21579,"scene, Miss�""",OH

21580,"""It's not true, sergeant,"" cried the clear voice of Miss Clarice Carroll. In a long",OH

21581,"coat of tan silk and a red-plumed hat, she bounded before the desk.",OH

21582,"""It's not my fault,"" she cried indignantly. ""How dare they say such a thing! I've",OH

21583,"played the title r�le ever since it was staged, and if you want to know who",OH

21584,"made it a success, ask the public�that's all.""",OH

21585,"""What Miss Carroll says is true in part,"" said the author. ""For five months the",OH

21586,comedietta was a drawing-card in the best houses. But during the last two,OH

21587,weeks it has lost favour. There is one scene in it in which Miss Carroll made a,OH

21588,big hit. Now she hardly gets a hand out of it. She spoils it by acting it entirely,OH

21589,"different from her old way.""",OH

21590,"""It is not my fault,"" reiterated the actress.",OH

21591,"""There are only two of you on in the scene,"" argued the playwright hotly, ""you",OH

21592,"and Delmars, here�""",OH

21593,"""Then it's his fault,"" declared Miss Carroll, with a lightning glance of scorn",OH

21594,"from her dark eyes. The comedian caught it, and gazed with increased",OH

21595,melancholy at the panels of the sergeant's desk.,OH

21596,The night was a dull one in that particular police station.,OH

21597,The sergeant's long-blunted curiosity awoke a little.,OH

21598,"""I've heard you,"" he said to the author. And then he addressed the thin-faced",OH

21599,"and ascetic-looking lady of the company who played ""Aunt Turnip-top"" in the",OH

21600,little comedy.,OH

21601,"""Who do you think spoils the scene you are fussing about?"" he asked.",OH

21602,"""I'm no knocker,"" said that lady, ""and everybody knows it. So, when I say that",OH

21603,Clarice falls down every time in that scene I'm judging her art and not herself.,OH

21604,She was great in it once. She does it something fierce now. It'll dope the show,OH

21605,"if she keeps it up.""",OH

21606,The sergeant looked at the comedian.,OH

21608,"use asking you which one of you queers it?""",OH

21609,The comedian avoided the direct rays from the two fixed stars of Miss,OH

21638,"The matron of the police station had been standing near, listening to the",OH

21644,"As the title implies, Miss Carroll's r�le is that of a gay, rollicking,",OH

21661,across the arm of the policeman who still stood officially among them.,OH

21662,"Miss Carroll had gone to supper well cloaked, but in the costume of the tropic",OH

21663,wood nymph. A skirt of fern leaves touched her knee; she was like a,OH

21719,The judge of the United States court of the district lying along the Rio Grande,OH

21721,JUDGE:,OH

21722,When you sent me up for four years you made a talk. Among other hard,OH

21723,"things, you called me a rattlesnake. Maybe I am one�anyhow, you hear me",OH

21724,"rattling now. One year after I got to the pen, my daughter died of�well, they",OH

21725,"said it was poverty and the disgrace together. You've got a daughter, Judge,",OH

21726,and I'm going to make you know how it feels to lose one. And I'm going to,OH

21727,"bite that district attorney that spoke against me. I'm free now, and I guess I've",OH

21728,"turned to rattlesnake all right. I feel like one. I don't say much, but this is my",OH

21729,rattle. Look out when I strike.,OH

21730,"Yours respectfully,",OH

21731,RATTLESNAKE.,OH

21732,Judge Derwent threw the letter carelessly aside. It was nothing new to receive,OH

21733,such epistles from desperate men whom he had been called upon to judge. He,OH

21734,"felt no alarm. Later on he showed the letter to Littlefield, the young district",OH

21735,"attorney, for Littlefield's name was included in the threat, and the judge was",OH

21736,punctilious in matters between himself and his fellow men.,OH

21737,"Littlefield honoured the rattle of the writer, as far as it concerned himself, with",OH

21738,a smile of contempt; but he frowned a little over the reference to the Judge's,OH

21739,"daughter, for he and Nancy Derwent were to be married in the fall.",OH

21740,Littlefield went to the clerk of the court and looked over the records with him.,OH

21741,"They decided that the letter might have been sent by Mexico Sam, a half-breed",OH

21742,border desperado who had been imprisoned for manslaughter four years,OH

21743,"before. Then official duties crowded the matter from his mind, and the rattle of",OH

21744,the revengeful serpent was forgotten.,OH

21745,Court was in session at Brownsville. Most of the cases to be tried were,OH

21746,"charges of smuggling, counterfeiting, post-office robberies, and violations of",OH

21747,"Federal laws along the border. One case was that of a young Mexican, Rafael",OH

21748,"Ortiz, who had been rounded up by a clever deputy marshal in the act of",OH

21749,passing a counterfeit silver dollar. He had been suspected of many such,OH

21750,"deviations from rectitude, but this was the first time that anything provable",OH

21751,"had been fixed upon him. Ortiz languished cozily in jail, smoking brown",OH

21752,"cigarettes and waiting for trial. Kilpatrick, the deputy, brought the counterfeit",OH

21753,dollar and handed it to the district attorney in his office in the court-house. The,OH

21754,deputy and a reputable druggist were prepared to swear that Ortiz paid for a,OH

21755,"bottle of medicine with it. The coin was a poor counterfeit, soft, dull-looking,",OH

21756,and made principally of lead. It was the day before the morning on which the,OH

21757,"docket would reach the case of Ortiz, and the district attorney was preparing",OH

21758,himself for trial.,OH

21759,"""Not much need of having in high-priced experts to prove the coin's queer, is",OH

21760,"there, Kil?"" smiled Littlefield, as he thumped the dollar down upon the table,",OH

21761,where it fell with no more ring than would have come from a lump of putty.,OH

21762,"""I guess the Greaser's as good as behind the bars,"" said the deputy, easing up",OH

21763,"his holsters. ""You've got him dead. If it had been just one time, these Mexicans",OH

21764,can't tell good money from bad; but this little yaller rascal belongs to a gang of,OH

21765,"counterfeiters, I know. This is the first time I've been able to catch him doing",OH

21766,the trick. He's got a girl down there in them Mexican jacals on the river bank. I,OH

21767,seen her one day when I was watching him. She's as pretty as a red heifer in a,OH

21768,"flower bed.""",OH

21769,"Littlefield shoved the counterfeit dollar into his pocket, and slipped his",OH

21771,"frank and jolly as a boy's, appeared in the doorway, and in walked Nancy",OH

21772,Derwent.,OH

21773,"""Oh, Bob, didn't court adjourn at twelve to-day until to-morrow?"" she asked of",OH

21774,Littlefield.,OH

21775,"""It did,"" said the district attorney, ""and I'm very glad of it. I've got a lot of",OH

21776,"rulings to look up, and�""",OH

21777,"""Now, that's just like you. I wonder you and father don't turn to law books or",OH

21783,They were to be married in the fall. The glamour was at its height. The plovers,OH

21784,"won the day�or, rather, the afternoon�over the calf-bound authorities.",OH

21785,Littlefield began to put his papers away.,OH

21786,"There was a knock at the door. Kilpatrick answered it. A beautiful, dark-eyed",OH

21787,girl with a skin tinged with the faintest lemon colour walked into the room. A,OH

21788,black shawl was thrown over her head and wound once around her neck.,OH

21789,"She began to talk in Spanish, a voluble, mournful stream of melancholy music.",OH

21790,"Littlefield did not understand Spanish. The deputy did, and he translated her",OH

21792,words.,OH

21793,"""She came to see you, Mr. Littlefield. Her name's Joya Trevi�as. She wants to",OH

21795,his girl. She says he's innocent. She says she made the money and got him to,OH

21796,"pass it. Don't you believe her, Mr. Littlefield. That's the way with these",OH

21797,"Mexican girls; they'll lie, steal, or kill for a fellow when they get stuck on him.",OH

21798,"Never trust a woman that's in love!""",OH

21799,"""Mr. Kilpatrick!""",OH

21800,Nancy Derwent's indignant exclamation caused the deputy to flounder for a,OH

21801,"moment in attempting to explain that he had misquoted his own sentiments,",OH

21802,and then he went on with the translation:,OH

21803,"""She says she's willing to take his place in the jail if you'll let him out. She",OH

21804,"says she was down sick with the fever, and the doctor said she'd die if she",OH

21806,"She says it saved her life. This Rafael seems to be her honey, all right; there's a",OH

21807,"lot of stuff in her talk about love and such things that you don't want to hear.""",OH

21808,It was an old story to the district attorney.,OH

21810,"and he will have to make his fight before the court.""",OH

21811,Nancy Derwent was not so hardened. She was looking with sympathetic,OH

21812,interest at Joya Trevi�as and at Littlefield alternately. The deputy repeated the,OH

21813,district attorney's words to the girl. She spoke a sentence or two in a low,OH

21814,"voice, pulled her shawl closely about her face, and left the room.",OH

21815,"""What did she say then?"" asked the district attorney.",OH

21816,"""Nothing special,"" said the deputy. ""She said: 'If the life of the one'�let's see",OH

21819,Kilpatrick strolled out through the corridor in the direction of the marshal's,OH

21820,office.,OH

21821,"""Can't you do anything for them, Bob?"" asked Nancy. ""It's such a little thing�",OH

21822,just one counterfeit dollar�to ruin the happiness of two lives! She was in,OH

21824,"pity?""",OH

21825,"""It hasn't a place in jurisprudence, Nan,"" said Littlefield, ""especially in re the",OH

21831,"The plover-shooting was fine that afternoon, and in the excitement of the sport",OH

21832,the case of Rafael and the grief of Joya Trevi�as was forgotten. The district,OH

21833,attorney and Nancy Derwent drove out from the town three miles along a,OH

21834,"smooth, grassy road, and then struck across a rolling prairie toward a heavy",OH

21835,"line of timber on Piedra Creek. Beyond this creek lay Long Prairie, the",OH

21836,favourite haunt of the plover. As they were nearing the creek they heard the,OH

21837,"galloping of a horse to their right, and saw a man with black hair and a",OH

21838,"swarthy face riding toward the woods at a tangent, as if he had come up",OH

21839,behind them.,OH

21840,"""I've seen that fellow somewhere,"" said Littlefield, who had a memory for",OH

21841,"faces, ""but I can't exactly place him. Some ranchman, I suppose, taking a short",OH

21842,"cut home.""",OH

21843,"They spent an hour on Long Prairie, shooting from the buckboard. Nancy",OH

21844,"Derwent, an active, outdoor Western girl, was pleased with her twelve-bore.",OH

21845,She had bagged within two brace of her companion's score.,OH

21846,They started homeward at a gentle trot. When within a hundred yards of,OH

21847,Piedra Creek a man rode out of the timber directly toward them.,OH

21848,"""It looks like the man we saw coming over,"" remarked Miss Derwent.",OH

21849,"As the distance between them lessened, the district attorney suddenly pulled",OH

21850,"up his team sharply, with his eyes fixed upon the advancing horseman. That",OH

21851,individual had drawn a Winchester from its scabbard on his saddle and thrown,OH

21852,it over his arm.,OH

21853,"""Now I know you, Mexico Sam!"" muttered Littlefield to himself. ""It was you",OH

21854,"who shook your rattles in that gentle epistle.""",OH

21855,Mexico Sam did not leave things long in doubt. He had a nice eye in all,OH

21856,"matters relating to firearms, so when he was within good rifle range, but",OH

21857,"outside of danger from No. 8 shot, he threw up his Winchester and opened fire",OH

21858,upon the occupants of the buckboard.,OH

21859,The first shot cracked the back of the seat within the two-inch space between,OH

21860,the shoulders of Littlefield and Miss Derwent. The next went through the,OH

21861,dashboard and Littlefield's trouser leg.,OH

21862,The district attorney hustled Nancy out of the buck-board to the ground. She,OH

21863,"was a little pale, but asked no questions. She had the frontier instinct that",OH

21864,accepts conditions in an emergency without superfluous argument. They kept,OH

21865,"their guns in hand, and Littlefield hastily gathered some handfuls of cartridges",OH

21866,from the pasteboard box on the seat and crowded them into his pockets.,OH

21867,"""Keep behind the horses, Nan,"" he commanded. ""That fellow is a ruffian I sent",OH

21868,to prison once. He's trying to get even. He knows our shot won't hurt him at,OH

21869,"that distance.""",OH

21870,"""All right, Bob,"" said Nancy steadily. ""I'm not afraid. But you come close, too.",OH

21871,"Whoa, Bess; stand still, now!""",OH

21872,"She stroked Bess's mane. Littlefield stood with his gun ready, praying that the",OH

21873,desperado would come within range.,OH

21874,But Mexico Sam was playing his vendetta along safe lines. He was a bird of,OH

21875,different feather from the plover. His accurate eye drew an imaginary line of,OH

21876,"circumference around the area of danger from bird-shot, and upon this line lie",OH

21877,"rode. His horse wheeled to the right, and as his victims rounded to the safe",OH

21878,side of their equine breast-work he sent a ball through the district attorney's,OH

21879,"hat. Once he miscalculated in making a d�tour, and over-stepped his margin.",OH

21880,"Littlefield's gun flashed, and Mexico Sam ducked his head to the harmless",OH

21881,"patter of the shot. A few of them stung his horse, which pranced promptly",OH

21882,back to the safety line.,OH

21883,The desperado fired again. A little cry came from Nancy Derwent. Littlefield,OH

21884,"whirled, with blazing eyes, and saw the blood trickling down her cheek.",OH

21885,"""I'm not hurt, Bob�only a splinter struck me. I think he hit one of the wheelspokes.""",OH

21886,"""Lord!"" groaned Littlefield. ""If I only had a charge of buckshot!""",OH

21887,"The ruffian got his horse still, and took careful aim. Fly gave a snort and fell in",OH

21888,"the harness, struck in the neck. Bess, now disabused of the idea that plover",OH

21889,"were being fired at, broke her traces and galloped wildly away. Mexican Sam",OH

21890,sent a ball neatly through the fulness of Nancy Derwent's shooting jacket.,OH

21891,"""Lie down�lie down!"" snapped Littlefield. ""Close to the horse�flat on the",OH

21892,"ground�so."" He almost threw her upon the grass against the back of the",OH

21893,"recumbent Fly. Oddly enough, at that moment the words of the Mexican girl",OH

21894,returned to his mind:,OH

21895,"""If the life of the girl you love is ever in danger, remember Rafael Ortiz.""",OH

21896,Littlefield uttered an exclamation.,OH

21897,"""Open fire on him, Nan, across the horse's back. Fire as fast as you can! You",OH

21902,Mexico Sam waited patiently until this innocuous fusillade ceased. He had,OH

21903,"plenty of time, and he did not care to risk the chance of a bird-shot in his eye",OH

21904,when it could be avoided by a little caution. He pulled his heavy Stetson low,OH

21905,"down over his face until the shots ceased. Then he drew a little nearer, and",OH

21906,fired with careful aim at what he could see of his victims above the fallen,OH

21907,horse.,OH

21908,Neither of them moved. He urged his horse a few steps nearer. He saw the,OH

21909,district attorney rise to one knee and deliberately level his shotgun. He pulled,OH

21910,his hat down and awaited the harmless rattle of the tiny pellets.,OH

21911,"The shotgun blazed with a heavy report. Mexico Sam sighed, turned limp all",OH

21969,Just on the half-hour he reached the corner where lay the gloves and the paper.,OH

21970,But he strangely ignored that which he had come to seek. He was holding two,OH

21971,little hands as tightly as ever he could and looking into two penitent brown,OH

21972,"eyes, while joy rioted in his heart.",OH

21973,"""Dear Jack,"" she said, ""I knew you would be here on time.""",OH

21975,"it's all right.""",OH

21976,"A big wind puffed out of the west, picked up the paper from the sidewalk,",OH

21977,opened it out and sent it flying and whirling down a side street. Up that street,OH

21978,"was driving a skittish bay to a spider-wheel buggy, the young man who had",OH

21979,written to the heart-to-heart editor for a recipe that he might win her for whom,OH

21980,he sighed.,OH

21981,"The wind, with a prankish flurry, flapped the flying newspaper against the face",OH

21982,of the skittish bay. There was a lengthened streak of bay mingled with the red,OH

21983,of running gear that stretched itself out for four blocks. Then a water-hydrant,OH

21984,"played its part in the cosmogony, the buggy became matchwood as",OH

21985,"foreordained, and the driver rested very quietly where he had been flung on",OH

21993,"its dishevelled leaves with his big, slow fingers, he stood a few feet from the",OH

22004,"paper home with him. His sister was named Gladys, and she had written to the",OH

22005,beauty editor of the paper asking for the practicable touchstone of beauty. That,OH

22006,"was weeks ago, and she had ceased to look for an answer. Gladys was a pale",OH

22007,"girl, with dull eyes and a discontented expression. She was dressing to go up",OH

22008,to the avenue to get some braid. Beneath her skirt she pinned two leaves of the,OH

22009,paper Johnny had brought. When she walked the rustling sound was an exact,OH

22010,imitation of the real thing.,OH

22011,On the street she met the Brown girl from the flat below and stopped to talk.,OH

22014,"something spiteful and went her way, with pinched lips.",OH

22015,Gladys proceeded toward the avenue. Her eyes now sparkled like,OH

22016,"jagerfonteins. A rosy bloom visited her cheeks; a triumphant, subtle, vivifying,",OH

22017,smile transfigured her face. She was beautiful. Could the beauty editor have,OH

22018,"seen her then! There was something in her answer in the paper, I believe,",OH

22019,about cultivating kind feelings toward others in order to make plain features,OH

22020,attractive.,OH

22021,The labour leader against whom the paper's solemn and weighty editorial,OH

22022,injunction was laid was the father of Gladys and Johnny. He picked up the,OH

22023,remains of the journal from which Gladys had ravished a cosmetic of silken,OH

22024,"sounds. The editorial did not come under his eye, but instead it was greeted by",OH

22026,simpleton and the sage.,OH

22032,"referred, in coloured inks, to the clarion tone of its successful denunciation of",OH

22033,the labour leader's intended designs.,OH

22034,The remaining leaves of the active journal also went loyally to the proving of,OH

22035,its potency.,OH

22037,"missing columns from the inside of his clothing, where they had been artfully",OH

22038,distributed so as to successfully defend such areas as are generally attacked,OH

22039,during scholastic castigations. Johnny attended a private school and had had,OH

22040,"trouble with his teacher. As has been said, there was an excellent editorial",OH

22159,at work and offer him a red sled and a pair of skates not to awaken his sick,OH

22162,The burglar wiped his hands on the tablecloth and arose with a yawn.,OH

22163,"""Well, let's get through with it,"" he said. ""God bless you, my little boy! you",OH

22176,"""I'm sorry,"" said Tommy, sympathetically. ""But I can't help myself any more",OH

22179,"heroine, or at the last moment by his old pal, Red Mike, who recognizes the",OH

22251,"The cattlemen then swept out upon him, calling for vengeance, for, while the",OH

22252,"slaughter of a sheepman has not always lacked condonement, it was a decided",OH

22255,"""Christmas comes but once a year"" to the guests.",OH

22256,"But the sortie failed in its vengeance. McRoy was on his horse and away,",OH

22260,"a dangerous man. When officers went after him for the shooting of Carson, he",OH

22261,"killed two of them, and entered upon the life of an outlaw. He became a",OH

22263,"raise a quarrel at the slightest opportunity, pick off his man and laugh at the",OH

22264,"officers of the law. He was so cool, so deadly, so rapid, so inhumanly bloodthirsty that none but faint attempts were ever made to capture him. When he",OH

22265,was at last shot and killed by a little one-armed Mexican who was nearly dead,OH

22266,"himself from fright, the Frio Kid had the deaths of eighteen men on his head.",OH

22267,About half of these were killed in fair duels depending upon the quickness of,OH

22268,the draw. The other half were men whom he assassinated from absolute,OH

22269,wantonness and cruelty.,OH

22270,Many tales are told along the border of his impudent courage and daring. But,OH

22271,he was not one of the breed of desperadoes who have seasons of generosity,OH

22272,and even of softness. They say he never had mercy on the object of his anger.,OH

22273,"Yet at this and every Christmastide it is well to give each one credit, if it can",OH

22274,"be done, for whatever speck of good he may have possessed. If the Frio Kid",OH

22275,ever did a kindly act or felt a throb of generosity in his heart it was once at,OH

22514,beginning to understand its heartbeats. It is like a great river fed by a hundred,OH

22515,"alien streams. Each influx brings strange seeds on its flood, strange silt and",OH

22516,"weeds, and now and then a flower of rare promise. To construe this river",OH

22517,"requires a man who can build dykes against the overflow, who is a naturalist, a",OH

22518,"geologist, a humanitarian, a diver and a strong swimmer. I love my Bowery. It",OH

22519,was my cradle and is my inspiration. I have published one book. The critics,OH

22520,"have been kind. I put my heart in it. I am writing another, into which I hope to",OH

22521,"put both heart and brain. Consider me your guide, gentlemen. Is there anything",OH

22522,"I can take you to see, any place to which I can conduct you?""",OH

22542,leisurely German�possibly old Kampfer himself�will bring it to you. It will,OH

22553,The Commissioner of the Land Office was of the old style; his antique,OH

22554,"courtesy was too formal for his day. He dressed in fine black, and there was a",OH

22555,suggestion of Roman drapery in his long coat-skirts. His collars were,OH

22556,"""undetached"" (blame haberdashery for the word); his tie was a narrow,",OH

22557,"funereal strip, tied in the same knot as were his shoe-strings. His gray hair was",OH

22558,"a trifle too long behind, but he kept it smooth and orderly. His face was cleanshaven, like the old statesmen's. Most people thought it a stern face, but when",OH

22559,"its official expression was off, a few had seen altogether a different",OH

22560,countenance. Especially tender and gentle it had appeared to those who were,OH

22561,about him during the last illness of his only child.,OH

22562,"The Commissioner had been a widower for years, and his life, outside his",OH

22563,"official duties, had been so devoted to little Georgia that people spoke of it as",OH

22564,"a touching and admirable thing. He was a reserved man, and dignified almost",OH

22565,"to austerity, but the child had come below it all and rested upon his very heart,",OH

22566,so that she scarcely missed the mother's love that had been taken away. There,OH

22567,"was a wonderful companionship between them, for she had many of his own",OH

22568,"ways, being thoughtful and serious beyond her years.",OH

22569,"One day, while she was lying with the fever burning brightly in her checks,",OH

22570,she said suddenly:,OH

22571,"""Papa, I wish I could do something good for a whole lot of children!""",OH

22572,"""What would you like to do, dear?"" asked the Commissioner. ""Give them a",OH

22573,"party?""",OH

22574,"""Oh, I don't mean those kind. I mean poor children who haven't homes, and",OH

22575,"aren't loved and cared for as I am. I tell you what, papa!""",OH

22576,"""What, my own child?""",OH

22577,"""If I shouldn't get well, I'll leave them you�not give you, but just lend you,",OH

22578,"for you must come to mamma and me when you die too. If you can find time,",OH

22579,"wouldn't you do something to help them, if I ask you, papa?""",OH

22580,"""Hush, hush dear, dear child,"" said the Commissioner, holding her hot little",OH

22581,"hand against his cheek; ""you'll get well real soon, and you and I will see what",OH

22582,"we can do for them together.""",OH

22583,"But in whatsoever paths of benevolence, thus vaguely premeditated, the",OH

22584,"Commissioner might tread, he was not to have the company of his beloved.",OH

22585,"That night the little frail body grew suddenly too tired to struggle further, and",OH

22586,Georgia's exit was made from the great stage when she had scarcely begun to,OH

22587,speak her little piece before the footlights. But there must be a stage manager,OH

22588,who understands. She had given the cue to the one who was to speak after her.,OH

22589,"A week after she was laid away, the Commissioner reappeared at the office, a",OH

22590,"little more courteous, a little paler and sterner, with the black frock-coat",OH

22591,hanging a little more loosely from his tall figure.,OH

22592,His desk was piled with work that had accumulated during the four,OH

22593,"heartbreaking weeks of his absence. His chief clerk had done what he could,",OH

22594,"but there were questions of law, of fine judicial decisions to be made",OH

22595,"concerning the issue of patents, the marketing and leasing of school lands, the",OH

22596,"classification into grazing, agricultural, watered, and timbered, of new tracts to",OH

22597,be opened to settlers.,OH

22598,"The Commissioner went to work silently and obstinately, putting back his",OH

22599,"grief as far as possible, forcing his mind to attack the complicated and",OH

22600,important business of his office. On the second day after his return he called,OH

22601,"the porter, pointed to a leather-covered chair that stood near his own, and",OH

22602,ordered it removed to a lumber-room at the top of the building. In that chair,OH

22603,Georgia would always sit when she came to the office for him of afternoons.,OH

22604,"As time passed, the Commissioner seemed to grow more silent, solitary, and",OH

22605,reserved. A new phase of mind developed in him. He could not endure the,OH

22606,presence of a child. Often when a clattering youngster belonging to one of the,OH

22607,clerks would come chattering into the big business-room adjoining his little,OH

22608,"apartment, the Commissioner would steal softly and close the door. He would",OH

22609,always cross the street to avoid meeting the school-children when they came,OH

22610,"dancing along in happy groups upon the sidewalk, and his firm mouth would",OH

22611,close into a mere line.,OH

22612,"It was nearly three months after the rains had washed the last dead flowerpetals from the mound above little Georgia when the ""land-shark"" firm of",OH

22613,"Hamlin and Avery filed papers upon what they considered the ""fattest""",OH

22614,vacancy of the year.,OH

22615,"It should not be supposed that all who were termed ""land-sharks"" deserved the",OH

22616,name. Many of them were reputable men of good business character. Some of,OH

22617,them could walk into the most august councils of the State and say:,OH

22618,"""Gentlemen, we would like to have this, and that, and matters go thus."" But,",OH

22619,"next to a three years' drought and the boll-worm, the Actual Settler hated the",OH

22620,"Land-shark. The land-shark haunted the Land Office, where all the land",OH

22621,"records were kept, and hunted ""vacancies""�that is, tracts of unappropriated",OH

22622,"public domain, generally invisible upon the official maps, but actually existing",OH

22623,"""upon the ground."" The law entitled any one possessing certain State scrip to",OH

22624,file by virtue of same upon any land not previously legally appropriated. Most,OH

22625,"of the scrip was now in the hands of the land-sharks. Thus, at the cost of a few",OH

22626,"hundred dollars, they often secured lands worth as many thousands. Naturally,",OH

22627,"the search for ""vacancies"" was lively.",OH

22628,"But often�very often�the land they thus secured, though legally",OH

22629,"""unappropriated,"" would be occupied by happy and contented settlers, who",OH

22630,"had laboured for years to build up their homes, only to discover that their titles",OH

22631,"were worthless, and to receive peremptory notice to quit. Thus came about the",OH

22632,bitter and not unjustifiable hatred felt by the toiling settlers toward the shrewd,OH

22633,and seldom merciful speculators who so often turned them forth destitute and,OH

22634,homeless from their fruitless labours. The history of the state teems with their,OH

22635,"antagonism. Mr. Land-shark seldom showed his face on ""locations"" from",OH

22636,which he should have to eject the unfortunate victims of a monstrously tangled,OH

22637,"land system, but let his emissaries do the work. There was lead in every cabin,",OH

22638,moulded into balls for him; many of his brothers had enriched the grass with,OH

22639,their blood. The fault of it all lay far back.,OH

22640,"When the state was young, she felt the need of attracting newcomers, and of",OH

22641,rewarding those pioneers already within her borders. Year after year she issued,OH

22642,"land scrip�Headrights, Bounties, Veteran Donations, Confederates; and to",OH

22643,"railroads, irrigation companies, colonies, and tillers of the soil galore. All",OH

22644,required of the grantee was that he or it should have the scrip properly,OH

22645,"surveyed upon the public domain by the county or district surveyor, and the",OH

22646,"land thus appropriated became the property of him or it, or his or its heirs and",OH

22647,"assigns, forever.",OH

22648,In those days�and here is where the trouble began�the state's domain was,OH

22649,"practically inexhaustible, and the old surveyors, with princely�yea, even",OH

22650,"Western American�liberality, gave good measure and over-flowing. Often the",OH

22651,jovial man of metes and bounds would dispense altogether with the tripod and,OH

22652,"chain. Mounted on a pony that could cover something near a ""vara"" at a step,",OH

22653,"with a pocket compass to direct his course, he would trot out a survey by",OH

22654,"counting the beat of his pony's hoofs, mark his corners, and write out his field",OH

22655,notes with the complacency produced by an act of duty well performed.,OH

22656,Sometimes�and who could blame the surveyor?�when the pony was,OH

22657,"""feeling his oats,"" he might step a little higher and farther, and in that case the",OH

22658,beneficiary of the scrip might get a thousand or two more acres in his survey,OH

22659,than the scrip called for. But look at the boundless leagues the state had to,OH

22660,"spare! However, no one ever had to complain of the pony under-stepping.",OH

22661,Nearly every old survey in the state contained an excess of land.,OH

22662,"In later years, when the state became more populous, and land values",OH

22663,"increased, this careless work entailed incalculable trouble, endless litigation, a",OH

22664,"period of riotous land-grabbing, and no little bloodshed. The land-sharks",OH

22665,"voraciously attacked these excesses in the old surveys, and filed upon such",OH

22666,portions with new scrip as unappropriated public domain. Wherever the,OH

22667,"identifications of the old tracts were vague, and the corners were not to be",OH

22668,"clearly established, the Land Office would recognize the newer locations as",OH

22669,"valid, and issue title to the locators. Here was the greatest hardship to be",OH

22670,"found. These old surveys, taken from the pick of the land, were already nearly",OH

22671,"all occupied by unsuspecting and peaceful settlers, and thus their titles were",OH

22672,"demolished, and the choice was placed before them either to buy their land",OH

22673,"over at a double price or to vacate it, with their families and personal",OH

22674,"belongings, immediately. Land locators sprang up by hundreds. The country",OH

22675,"was held up and searched for ""vacancies"" at the point of a compass. Hundreds",OH

22676,of thousands of dollars' worth of splendid acres were wrested from their,OH

22677,innocent purchasers and holders. There began a vast hegira of evicted settlers,OH

22678,"in tattered wagons; going nowhere, cursing injustice, stunned, purposeless,",OH

22679,"homeless, hopeless. Their children began to look up to them for bread, and",OH

22680,cry.,OH

22681,It was in consequence of these conditions that Hamilton and Avery had filed,OH

22682,"upon a strip of land about a mile wide and three miles long, comprising about",OH

22683,"two thousand acres, it being the excess over complement of the Elias Denny",OH

22684,"three-league survey on Chiquito River, in one of the middle-western counties.",OH

22685,"This two-thousand-acre body of land was asserted by them to be vacant land,",OH

22686,and improperly considered a part of the Denny survey. They based this,OH

22687,assertion and their claim upon the land upon the demonstrated facts that the,OH

22688,beginning corner of the Denny survey was plainly identified; that its field,OH

22689,"notes called to run west 5,760 varas, and then called for Chiquito River;",OH

22690,"thence it ran south, with the meanders�and so on�and that the Chiquito",OH

22691,"River was, on the ground, fully a mile farther west from the point reached by",OH

22692,course and distance. To sum up: there were two thousand acres of vacant land,OH

22693,between the Denny survey proper and Chiquito River.,OH

22694,One sweltering day in July the Commissioner called for the papers in,OH

22695,"connection with this new location. They were brought, and heaped, a foot",OH

22696,"deep, upon his desk�field notes, statements, sketches, affidavits, connecting",OH

22697,lines�documents of every description that shrewdness and money could call,OH

22698,to the aid of Hamlin and Avery.,OH

22699,The firm was pressing the Commissioner to issue a patent upon their location.,OH

22700,They possesed inside information concerning a new railroad that would,OH

22701,probably pass somewhere near this land.,OH

22702,The General Land Office was very still while the Commissioner was delving,OH

22703,into the heart of the mass of evidence. The pigeons could be heard on the roof,OH

22704,"of the old, castle-like building, cooing and fretting. The clerks were droning",OH

22705,"everywhere, scarcely pretending to earn their salaries. Each little sound echoed",OH

22706,"hollow and loud from the bare, stone-flagged floors, the plastered walls, and",OH

22707,"the iron-joisted ceiling. The impalpable, perpetual limestone dust that never",OH

22708,"settled, whitened a long streamer of sunlight that pierced the tattered windowawning.",OH

22709,It seemed that Hamlin and Avery had builded well. The Denny survey was,OH

22710,"carelessly made, even for a careless period. Its beginning corner was identical",OH

22711,"with that of a well-defined old Spanish grant, but its other calls were sinfully",OH

22712,"vague. The field notes contained no other object that survived�no tree, no",OH

22713,"natural object save Chiquito River, and it was a mile wrong there. According",OH

22714,"to precedent, the Office would be justified in giving it its complement by",OH

22715,"course and distance, and considering the remainder vacant instead of a mere",OH

22716,excess.,OH

22717,The Actual Settler was besieging the office with wild protests in re. Having,OH

22718,"the nose of a pointer and the eye of a hawk for the land-shark, he had observed",OH

22719,"his myrmidons running the lines upon his ground. Making inquiries, he",OH

22720,"learned that the spoiler had attacked his home, and he left the plough in the",OH

22721,furrow and took his pen in hand.,OH

22722,"One of the protests the Commissioner read twice. It was from a woman, a",OH

22723,"widow, the granddaughter of Elias Denny himself. She told how her",OH

22724,grandfather had sold most of the survey years before at a trivial price�land,OH

22725,that was now a principality in extent and value. Her mother had also sold a,OH

22726,"part, and she herself had succeeded to this western portion, along Chiquito",OH

22727,"River. Much of it she had been forced to part with in order to live, and now",OH

22728,"she owned only about three hundred acres, on which she had her home. Her",OH

22729,letter wound up rather pathetically:,OH

22730,"""I've got eight children, the oldest fifteen years. I work all day and half the",OH

22731,night to till what little land I can and keep us in clothes and books. I teach my,OH

22732,children too. My neighbours is all poor and has big families. The drought kills,OH

22733,the crops every two or three years and then we has hard times to get enough to,OH

22734,eat. There is ten families on this land what the land-sharks is trying to rob us,OH

22735,"of, and all of them got titles from me. I sold to them cheap, and they aint paid",OH

22736,"out yet, but part of them is, and if their land should be took from them I would",OH

22737,"die. My grandfather was an honest man, and he helped to build up this state,",OH

22738,"and he taught his children to be honest, and how could I make it up to them",OH

22739,"who bought from me? Mr. Commissioner, if you let them land-sharks take the",OH

22740,"roof from over my children and the little from them as they has to live on,",OH

22741,whoever again calls this state great or its government just will have a lie in,OH

22742,"their mouths""",OH

22743,"The Commissioner laid this letter aside with a sigh. Many, many such letters",OH

22744,"he had received. He had never been hurt by them, nor had he ever felt that they",OH

22745,"appealed to him personally. He was but the state's servant, and must follow its",OH

22746,"laws. And yet, somehow, this reflection did not always eliminate a certain",OH

22747,responsible feeling that hung upon him. Of all the state's officers he was,OH

22748,"supremest in his department, not even excepting the Governor. Broad, general",OH

22749,"land laws he followed, it was true, but he had a wide latitude in particular",OH

22750,"ramifications. Rather than law, what he followed was Rulings: Office Rulings",OH

22751,and precedents. In the complicated and new questions that were being,OH

22752,engendered by the state's development the,OH

22753,Commissioner's ruling was rarely appealed from. Even the courts sustained it,OH

22754,when its equity was apparent.,OH

22755,The Commissioner stepped to the door and spoke to a clerk in the other room,OH

22756,"�spoke as he always did, as if he were addressing a prince of the blood:",OH

22757,"""Mr. Weldon, will you be kind enough to ask Mr. Ashe, the state school-land",OH

22758,"appraiser, to please come to my office as soon as convenient?""",OH

22759,Ashe came quickly from the big table where he was arranging his reports.,OH

22760,"""Mr. Ashe,"" said the Commissioner, ""you worked along the Chiquito River, in",OH

22761,"Salado County, during your last trip, I believe. Do you remember anything of",OH

22762,"the Elias Denny three-league survey?""",OH

22763,"""Yes, sir, I do,"" the blunt, breezy, surveyor answered. ""I crossed it on my way",OH

22764,"to Block H, on the north side of it. The road runs with the Chiquito River,",OH

22765,"along the valley. The Denny survey fronts three miles on the Chiquito.""",OH

22766,"""It is claimed,"" continued the commissioner, ""that it fails to reach the river by",OH

22767,"as much as a mile.""",OH

22768,The appraiser shrugged his shoulder. He was by birth and instinct an Actual,OH

22769,"Settler, and the natural foe of the land-shark.",OH

22770,"""It has always been considered to extend to the river,"" he said, dryly.",OH

22771,"""But that is not the point I desired to discuss,"" said the Commissioner. ""What",OH

22772,"kind of country is this valley portion of (let us say, then) the Denny tract?""",OH

22773,The spirit of the Actual Settler beamed in Ashe's face.,OH

22774,"""Beautiful,"" he said, with enthusiasm. ""Valley as level as this floor, with just a",OH

22775,"little swell on, like the sea, and rich as cream. Just enough brakes to shelter the",OH

22776,"cattle in winter. Black loamy soil for six feet, and then clay. Holds water. A",OH

22777,"dozen nice little houses on it, with windmills and gardens. People pretty poor,",OH

22778,I guess�too far from market�but comfortable. Never saw so many kids in,OH

22779,"my life.""",OH

22780,"""They raise flocks?"" inquired the Commissioner.",OH

22781,"""Ho, ho! I mean two-legged kids,"" laughed the surveyor; ""two-legged, and",OH

22782,"bare-legged, and tow-headed.""",OH

22783,"""Children! oh, children!"" mused the Commissioner, as though a new view had",OH

22784,"opened to him; ""they raise children!",OH

22785,"""It's a lonesome country, Commissioner,"" said the surveyor. ""Can you blame",OH

22786,"'em?""",OH

22787,"""I suppose,"" continued the Commissioner, slowly, as one carefully pursues",OH

22788,"deductions from a new, stupendous theory, ""not all of them are tow-headed. It",OH

22789,"would not be unreasonable, Mr. Ashe, I conjecture, to believe that a portion of",OH

22791,"""Brown and black, sure,"" said Ashe; ""also red.""",OH

22792,"""No doubt,"" said the Commissioner. ""Well, I thank you for your courtesy in",OH

22793,"informing me, Mr. Ashe. I will not detain you any longer from your duties.""",OH

22794,"Later, in the afternoon, came Hamlin and Avery, big, handsome, genial,",OH

22795,"sauntering men, clothed in white duck and low-cut shoes. They permeated the",OH

22796,whole office with an aura of debonair prosperity. They passed among the,OH

22797,clerks and left a wake of abbreviated given names and fat brown cigars.,OH

22798,"These were the aristocracy of the land-sharks, who went in for big things. Full",OH

22799,"of serene confidence in themselves, there was no corporation, no syndicate, no",OH

22800,railroad company or attorney general too big for them to tackle. The peculiar,OH

22801,"smoke of their rare, fat brown cigars was to be perceived in the sanctum of",OH

22802,"every department of state, in every committee-room of the Legislature, in",OH

22803,every bank parlour and every private caucus-room in the state Capital. Always,OH

22804,"pleasant, never in a hurry, in seeming to possess unlimited leisure, people",OH

22805,wondered when they gave their attention to the many audacious enterprises in,OH

22806,which they were known to be engaged.,OH

22807,By and by the two dropped carelessly into the Commissioner's room and,OH

22808,"reclined lazily in the big, leather-upholstered arm-chairs. They drawled a",OH

22809,"good-natured complaint of the weather, and Hamlin told the Commissioner an",OH

22810,excellent story he had amassed that morning from the Secretary of State.,OH

22811,But the Commissioner knew why they were there. He had half promised to,OH

22812,render a decision that day upon their location.,OH

22813,The chief clerk now brought in a batch of duplicate certificates for the,OH

22814,"Commissioner to sign. As he traced his sprawling signature, ""Hollis",OH

22815,"Summerfield, Comr. Genl. Land Office,"" on each one, the chief clerk stood,",OH

22816,deftly removing them and applying the blotter.,OH

22817,"""I notice,"" said the chief clerk, ""you've been going through that Salado County",OH

22818,"location. Kampfer is making a new map of Salado, and I believe is platting in",OH

22819,"that section of the county now.""",OH

22820,"""I will see it,"" said the Commissioner. A few moments later he went to the",OH

22821,draughtsmen's room.,OH

22822,As he entered he saw five or six of the draughtsmen grouped about Kampfer's,OH

22823,"desk, gargling away at each other in pectoral German, and gazing at something",OH

22824,thereupon. At the Commissioner's approach they scattered to their several,OH

22825,"places. Kampfer, a wizened little German, with long, frizzled ringlets and a",OH

22826,"watery eye, began to stammer forth some sort of an apology, the",OH

22827,"Commissioner thought, for the congregation of his fellows about his desk.",OH

22828,"""Never mind,"" said the Commissioner, ""I wish to see the map you are",OH

22829,"making""; and, passing around the old German, seated himself upon the high",OH

22830,draughtsman's stool. Kampfer continued to break English in trying to explain.,OH

22831,"""Herr Gommissioner, I assure you blenty sat I haf not it bremeditated�sat it",OH

22832,wass�sat it itself make. Look you! from se field notes wass it blatted�blease,OH

22833,"to observe se calls: South, 10 degrees west 1,050 varas; south, 10 degrees east",OH

22834,"300 varas; south, 100; south, 9 west, 200; south, 40 degrees west 400�and so",OH

22835,"on. Herr Gommissioner, nefer would I have�""",OH

22836,"The Commissioner raised one white hand, silently, Kampfer dropped his pipe",OH

22837,and fled.,OH

22838,"With a hand at each side of his face, and his elbows resting upon the desk, the",OH

22839,Commissioner sat staring at the map which was spread and fastened there�,OH

22840,staring at the sweet and living profile of little Georgia drawn thereupon�at,OH

22841,"her face, pensive, delicate, and infantile, outlined in a perfect likeness.",OH

22842,"When his mind at length came to inquire into the reason of it, he saw that it",OH

22843,"must have been, as Kampfer had said, unpremeditated. The old draughtsman",OH

22844,"had been platting in the Elias Denny survey, and Georgia's likeness, striking",OH

22845,"though it was, was formed by nothing more than the meanders of Chiquito",OH

22846,"River. Indeed, Kampfer's blotter, whereon his preliminary work was done,",OH

22847,showed the laborious tracings of the calls and the countless pricks of the,OH

22848,"compasses. Then, over his faint pencilling, Kampfer had drawn in India ink",OH

22849,"with a full, firm pen the similitude of Chiquito River, and forth had blossomed",OH

22850,"mysteriously the dainty, pathetic profile of the child.",OH

22851,"The Commissioner sat for half an hour with his face in his hands, gazing",OH

22852,"downward, and none dared approach him. Then he arose and walked out. In",OH

22853,the business office he paused long enough to ask that the Denny file be,OH

22854,brought to his desk.,OH

22855,"He found Hamlin and Avery still reclining in their chairs, apparently oblivious",OH

22856,"of business. They were lazily discussing summer opera, it being, their habit�",OH

22857,perhaps their pride also�to appear supernaturally indifferent whenever they,OH

22858,stood with large interests imperilled. And they stood to win more on this stake,OH

22859,than most people knew. They possessed inside information to the effect that a,OH

22860,"new railroad would, within a year, split this very Chiquito River valley and",OH

22861,send land values ballooning all along its route. A dollar under thirty thousand,OH

22862,"profit on this location, if it should hold good, would be a loss to their",OH

22863,"expectations. So, while they chatted lightly and waited for the Commissioner",OH

22864,"to open the subject, there was a quick, sidelong sparkle in their eyes, evincing",OH

22865,a desire to read their title clear to those fair acres on the Chiquito.,OH

22866,A clerk brought in the file. The Commissioner seated himself and wrote upon,OH

22867,it in red ink. Then he rose to his feet and stood for a while looking straight out,OH

22868,of the window. The Land Office capped the summit of a bold hill. The eyes of,OH

22869,the Commissioner passed over the roofs of many houses set in a packing of,OH

22870,"deep green, the whole checkered by strips of blinding white streets. The",OH

22871,"horizon, where his gaze was focussed, swelled to a fair wooded eminence",OH

22872,"flecked with faint dots of shining white. There was the cemetery, where lay",OH

22873,"many who were forgotten, and a few who had not lived in vain. And one lay",OH

22874,"there, occupying very small space, whose childish heart had been large enough",OH

22875,"to desire, while near its last beats, good to others. The Commissioner's lips",OH

22876,"moved slightly as he whispered to himself: ""It was her last will and testament,",OH

22877,"and I have neglected it so long!""",OH

22878,"The big brown cigars of Hamlin and Avery were fireless, but they still gripped",OH

22879,"them between their teeth and waited, while they marvelled at the absent",OH

22880,expression upon the Commissioner's face.,OH

22881,By and by he spoke suddenly and promptly.,OH

22882,"""Gentlemen, I have just indorsed the Elias Denny survey for patenting. This",OH

22883,"office will not regard your location upon a part of it as legal."" He paused a",OH

22884,"moment, and then, extending his hand as those dear old-time ones used to do",OH

22885,"in debate, he enunciated the spirit of that Ruling that subsequently drove the",OH

22886,"land-sharks to the wall, and placed the seal of peace and security over the",OH

22887,doors of ten thousand homes.,OH

22888,"""And, furthermore,"" he continued, with a clear, soft light upon his face, ""it",OH

22889,may interest you to know that from this time on this office will consider that,OH

22890,when a survey of land made by virtue of a certificate granted by this state to,OH

22891,the men who wrested it from the wilderness and the savage�made in good,OH

22892,"faith, settled in good faith, and left in good faith to their children or innocent",OH

22893,"purchasers�when such a survey, although overrunning its complement, shall",OH

22894,"call for any natural object visible to the eye of man, to that object it shall hold,",OH

22895,and be good and valid. And the children of this state shall lie down to sleep at,OH

22896,"night, and rumours of disturbers of title shall not disquiet them. For,""",OH

22897,"concluded the Commissioner, ""of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.""",OH

22898,"In the silence that followed, a laugh floated up from the patent-room below.",OH

22899,The man who carried down the Denny file was exhibiting it among the clerks.,OH

22900,"""Look here,"" he said, delightedly, ""the old man has forgotten his name. He's",OH

22901,"written 'Patent to original grantee,' and signed it 'Georgia Summerfield,",OH

22902,"Comr.""'",OH

22903,The speech of the Commissioner rebounded lightly from the impregnable,OH

22904,"Hamlin and Avery. They smiled, rose gracefully, spoke of the baseball team,",OH

22905,and argued feelingly that quite a perceptible breeze had arisen from the east.,OH

22906,"They lit fresh fat brown cigars, and drifted courteously away. But later they",OH

22907,"made another tiger-spring for their quarry in the courts. But the courts,",OH

22908,"according to reports in the papers, ""coolly roasted them"" (a remarkable",OH

22909,"performance, suggestive of liquid-air didoes), and sustained the",OH

22910,Commissioner's Ruling.,OH

22911,"And this Ruling itself grew to be a Precedent, and the Actual Settler framed it,",OH

22912,"and taught his children to spell from it, and there was sound sleep o' nights",OH

22913,"from the pines to the sage-brush, and from the chaparral to the great brown",OH

22914,river of the north.,OH

22915,"But I think, and I am sure the Commissioner never thought otherwise, that",OH

22916,"whether Kampfer was a snuffy old instrument of destiny, or whether the",OH

22917,meanders of the Chiquito accidentally platted themselves into that memorable,OH

22918,"sweet profile or not, there was brought about ""something good for a whole lot",OH

22919,"of children,"" and the result ought to be called ""Georgia's Ruling.""",OH

22921,BLIND MAN'S HOLIDAY,OH

22922,Alas for the man and for the artist with the shifting point of perspective! Life,OH

22923,shall be a confusion of ways to the one; the landscape shall rise up and,OH

22924,confound the other. Take the case of Lorison. At one time he appeared to,OH

22925,himself to be the feeblest of fools; at another he conceived that he followed,OH

22926,ideals so fine that the world was not yet ready to accept them. During one,OH

22927,"mood he cursed his folly; possessed by the other, he bore himself with a serene",OH

22928,grandeur akin to greatness: in neither did he attain the perspective.,OH

22929,"Generations before, the name had been ""Larsen."" His race had bequeathed him",OH

22930,"its fine-strung, melancholy temperament, its saving balance of thrift and",OH

22931,industry.,OH

22932,"From his point of perspective he saw himself an outcast from society, forever",OH

22933,to be a shady skulker along the ragged edge of respectability; a denizen des,OH

22934,"trois-quartz de monde, that pathetic spheroid lying between the haut and the",OH

22935,"demi, whose inhabitants envy each of their neighbours, and are scorned by",OH

22936,"both. He was self-condemned to this opinion, as he was self-exiled, through it,",OH

22937,to this quaint Southern city a thousand miles from his former home. Here he,OH

22938,"had dwelt for longer than a year, knowing but few, keeping in a subjective",OH

22939,world of shadows which was invaded at times by the perplexing bulks of,OH

22940,jarring realities. Then he fell in love with a girl whom he met in a cheap,OH

22941,"restaurant, and his story begins.",OH

22942,"The Rue Chartres, in New Orleans, is a street of ghosts. It lies in the quarter",OH

22943,"where the Frenchman, in his prime, set up his translated pride and glory;",OH

22944,"where, also, the arrogant don had swaggered, and dreamed of gold and grants",OH

22945,and ladies' gloves. Every flagstone has its grooves worn by footsteps going,OH

22946,royally to the wooing and the fighting. Every house has a princely heartbreak;,OH

22947,each doorway its untold tale of gallant promise and slow decay.,OH

22948,"By night the Rue Chartres is now but a murky fissure, from which the groping",OH

22949,"wayfarer sees, flung against the sky, the tangled filigree of Moorish iron",OH

22950,"balconies. The old houses of monsieur stand yet, indomitable against the",OH

22951,"century, but their essence is gone. The street is one of ghosts to whosoever can",OH

22952,see them.,OH

22953,A faint heartbeat of the street's ancient glory still survives in a corner occupied,OH

22954,"by the Caf� Carabine d'Or. Once men gathered there to plot against kings, and",OH

22955,"to warn presidents. They do so yet, but they are not the same kind of men. A",OH

22956,brass button will scatter these; those would have set their faces against an,OH

22957,"army. Above the door hangs the sign board, upon which has been depicted a",OH

22958,vast animal of unfamiliar species. In the act of firing upon this monster is,OH

22959,"represented an unobtrusive human levelling an obtrusive gun, once the colour",OH

22960,of bright gold. Now the legend above the picture is faded beyond conjecture;,OH

22961,"the gun's relation to the title is a matter of faith; the menaced animal, wearied",OH

22962,"of the long aim of the hunter, has resolved itself into a shapeless blot.",OH

22963,"The place is known as ""Antonio's,"" as the name, white upon the red-lit",OH

22964,"transparency, and gilt upon the windows, attests. There is a promise in",OH

22965,"""Antonio""; a justifiable expectancy of savoury things in oil and pepper and",OH

22966,"wine, and perhaps an angel's whisper of garlic. But the rest of the name is",OH

22971,"Its customers are working men and women, almost to a unit. Occasionally you",OH

22972,"will see chorus girls from the cheaper theatres, and men who follow",OH

22974,"Bohemian promise, but tame in fulfillment�manners debonair and gay are",OH

22975,"toned down to the ""family"" standard. Should you light a cigarette, mine host",OH

22976,"will touch you on the ""arrum"" and remind you that the proprieties are",OH

22977,"menaced. ""Antonio"" entices and beguiles from fiery legend without, but",OH

22978,"""O'Riley"" teaches decorum within.",OH

22979,It was at this restaurant that Lorison first saw the girl. A flashy fellow with a,OH

22980,"predatory eye had followed her in, and had advanced to take the other chair at",OH

22981,"the little table where she stopped, but Lorison slipped into the seat before him.",OH

22982,"Their acquaintance began, and grew, and now for two months they had sat at",OH

22983,"the same table each evening, not meeting by appointment, but as if by a series",OH

22984,"of fortuitous and happy accidents. After dining, they would take a walk",OH

22985,"together in one of the little city parks, or among the panoramic markets where",OH

22986,exhibits a continuous vaudeville of sights and sounds. Always at eight o'clock,OH

22987,"their steps led them to a certain street corner, where she prettily but firmly",OH

22988,"bade him good night and left him. ""I do not live far from here,"" she frequently",OH

22989,"said, ""and you must let me go the rest of the way alone.""",OH

22990,But now Lorison had discovered that he wanted to go the rest of the way with,OH

22991,"her, or happiness would depart, leaving, him on a very lonely corner of life.",OH

22992,"And at the same time that he made the discovery, the secret of his banishment",OH

22993,from the society of the good laid its finger in his face and told him it must not,OH

22994,be.,OH

22995,"Man is too thoroughly an egoist not to be also an egotist; if he love, the object",OH

22996,shall know it. During a lifetime he may conceal it through stress of expediency,OH

22997,"and honour, but it shall bubble from his dying lips, though it disrupt a",OH

22998,"neighbourhood. It is known, however, that most men do not wait so long to",OH

22999,"disclose their passion. In the case of Lorison, his particular ethics positively",OH

23000,"forbade him to declare his sentiments, but he must needs dally with the",OH

23001,"subject, and woo by innuendo at least.",OH

23002,"On this night, after the usual meal at the Carabine d'Or, he strolled with his",OH

23003,companion down the dim old street toward the river.,OH

23004,"The Rue Chartres perishes in the old Place d'Armes. The ancient Cabildo,",OH

23005,"where Spanish justice fell like hail, faces it, and the Cathedral, another",OH

23006,"provincial ghost, overlooks it. Its centre is a little, iron-railed park of flowers",OH

23007,"and immaculate gravelled walks, where citizens take the air of evenings.",OH

23008,"Pedestalled high above it, the general sits his cavorting steed, with his face",OH

23009,"turned stonily down the river toward English Turn, whence come no more",OH

23010,Britons to bombard his cotton bales.,OH

23011,"Often the two sat in this square, but to-night Lorison guided her past the stonestepped gate, and still riverward. As they walked, he smiled to himself to think",OH

23012,"that all he knew of her�except that be loved her�was her name, Norah",OH

23013,"Greenway, and that she lived with her brother. They had talked about",OH

23014,everything except themselves. Perhaps her reticence had been caused by his.,OH

23015,"They came, at length, upon the levee, and sat upon a great, prostrate beam.",OH

23016,The air was pungent with the dust of commerce. The great river slipped,OH

23017,"yellowly past. Across it Algiers lay, a longitudinous black bulk against a",OH

23018,vibrant electric haze sprinkled with exact stars.,OH

23019,The girl was young and of the piquant order. A certain bright melancholy,OH

23020,"pervaded her; she possessed an untarnished, pale prettiness doomed to please.",OH

23021,"Her voice, when she spoke, dwarfed her theme. It was the voice capable of",OH

23022,"investing little subjects with a large interest. She sat at ease, bestowing her",OH

23023,"skirts with the little womanly touch, serene as if the begrimed pier were a",OH

23024,summer garden. Lorison poked the rotting boards with his cane.,OH

23025,He began by telling her that he was in love with some one to whom he durst,OH

23026,"not speak of it. ""And why not?"" she asked, accepting swiftly his fatuous",OH

23027,"presentation of a third person of straw. ""My place in the world,"" he answered,",OH

23028,"""is none to ask a woman to share. I am an outcast from honest people; I am",OH

23029,"wrongly accused of one crime, and am, I believe, guilty of another.""",OH

23030,"Thence he plunged into the story of his abdication from society. The story,",OH

23031,"pruned of his moral philosophy, deserves no more than the slightest touch. It is",OH

23032,"no new tale, that of the gambler's declension. During one night's sitting he lost,",OH

23033,"and then had imperilled a certain amount of his employer's money, which, by",OH

23034,"accident, he carried with him. He continued to lose, to the last wager, and then",OH

23035,"began to gain, leaving the game winner to a somewhat formidable sum. The",OH

23036,same night his employer's safe was robbed. A search was had; the winnings of,OH

23037,"Lorison were found in his room, their total forming an accusative nearness to",OH

23038,"the sum purloined. He was taken, tried and, through incomplete evidence,",OH

23039,"released, smutched with the sinister devoirs of a disagreeing jury.",OH

23040,"""It is not in the unjust accusation,"" he said to the girl, ""that my burden lies, but",OH

23041,in the knowledge that from the moment I staked the first dollar of the firm's,OH

23042,money I was a criminal�no matter whether I lost or won. You see why it is,OH

23043,"impossible for me to speak of love to her.""",OH

23044,"""It is a sad thing,"" said Norah, after a little pause, ""to think what very good",OH

23045,"people there are in the world.""",OH

23046,"""Good?"" said Lorison.",OH

23047,"""I was thinking of this superior person whom you say you love. She must be a",OH

23068,"it down, I would not do it; but if it were fallen, I would pick it up, and thank",OH

23069,"Heaven for the privilege.""",OH

23070,"They were silent for some minutes. Norah shivered, and thrust her hands deep",OH

23071,into the pockets of her jacket. Lorison uttered a remorseful exclamation.,OH

23072,"""I'm not cold,"" she said. ""I was just thinking. I ought to tell you something.",OH

23073,You have selected a strange confidante. But you cannot expect a chance,OH

23074,"acquaintance, picked up in a doubtful restaurant, to be an angel.""",OH

23075,"""Norah!"" cried Lorison.",OH

23076,"""Let me go on. You have told me about yourself. We have been such good",OH

23077,friends. I must tell you now what I never wanted you to know. I am�worse,OH

23078,"than you are. I was on the stage . . . I sang in the chorus . . . I was pretty bad, I",OH

23079,guess . . . I stole diamonds from the prima donna . . . they arrested me . . . I,OH

23080,"gave most of them up, and they let me go . . . I drank wine every night . . . a",OH

23081,"great deal . . . I was very wicked, but�""",OH

23082,Lorison knelt quickly by her side and took her hands.,OH

23083,"""Dear Norah!"" he said, exultantly. ""It is you, it is you I love! You never",OH

23084,"guessed it, did you? 'Tis you I meant all the time. Now I can speak. Let me",OH

23085,"make you forget the past. We have both suffered; let us shut out the world, and",OH

23086,"live for each other. Norah, do you hear me say I love you?""",OH

23087,"""In spite of�""",OH

23088,"""Rather say because of it. You have come out of your past noble and good.",OH

23089,"Your heart is an angel's. Give it to me.""",OH

23090,"""A little while ago you feared the future too much to even speak.""",OH

23091,"""But for you; not for myself. Can you love me?""",OH

23092,"She cast herself, wildly sobbing, upon his breast.",OH

23093,"""Better than life�than truth itself�than everything.""",OH

23094,"""And my own past,"" said Lorison, with a note of solicitude�""can you forgive",OH

23095,"and�""",OH

23096,"""I answered you that,"" she whispered, ""when I told you I loved you."" She",OH

23097,"leaned away, and looked thoughtfully at him. ""If I had not told you about",OH

23098,"myself, would you have�would you�""",OH

23099,"""No,"" he interrupted; ""I would never have let you know I loved you. I would",OH

23100,"never have asked you this�Norah, will you be my wife?""",OH

23101,She wept again.,OH

23102,"""Oh, believe me; I am good now�I am no longer wicked! I will be the best",OH

23103,"wife in the world. Don't think I am�bad any more. If you do I shall die, I",OH

23104,"shall die!""",OH

23105,"While he was consoling, her, she brightened up, eager and impetuous. ""Will",OH

23106,"you marry me to-night?"" she said. ""Will you prove it that way. I have a reason",OH

23107,"for wishing it to be to-night. Will you?""",OH

23108,Of one of two things was this exceeding frankness the outcome: either of,OH

23109,importunate brazenness or of utter innocence. The lover's perspective,OH

23110,contained only the one.,OH

23111,"""The sooner,"" said Lorison, ""the happier I shall be.""",OH

23112,"""What is there to do?"" she asked. ""What do you have to get? Come! You",OH

23113,"should know.""",OH

23114,Her energy stirred the dreamer to action.,OH

23115,"""A city directory first,"" he cried, gayly, ""to find where the man lives who gives",OH

23116,"licenses to happiness. We will go together and rout him out. Cabs, cars,",OH

23117,"policemen, telephones and ministers shall aid us.""",OH

23118,"""Father Rogan shall marry us,"" said the girl, with ardour. ""I will take you to",OH

23119,"him.""",OH

23120,"An hour later the two stood at the open doorway of an immense, gloomy brick",OH

23121,building in a narrow and lonely street. The license was tight in Norah's hand.,OH

23122,"""Wait here a moment,"" she said, ""till I find Father Rogan.""",OH

23123,"She plunged into the black hallway, and the lover was left standing, as it were,",OH

23124,"on one leg, outside. His impatience was not greatly taxed. Gazing curiously",OH

23125,"into what seemed the hallway to Erebus, he was presently reassured by a",OH

23126,"stream of light that bisected the darkness, far down the passage. Then he heard",OH

23127,"her call, and fluttered lampward, like the moth. She beckoned him through a",OH

23128,doorway into the room whence emanated the light. The room was bare of,OH

23129,"nearly everything except books, which had subjugated all its space. Here and",OH

23130,"there little spots of territory had been reconquered. An elderly, bald man, with",OH

23131,"a superlatively calm, remote eye, stood by a table with a book in his hand, his",OH

23132,finger still marking a page. His dress was sombre and appertained to a,OH

23133,religious order. His eye denoted an acquaintance with the perspective.,OH

23134,"""Father Rogan,"" said Norah, ""this is he.""",OH

23135,"""The two of ye,"" said Father Rogan, ""want to get married?""",OH

23136,They did not deny it. He married them. The ceremony was quickly done. One,OH

23137,"who could have witnessed it, and felt its scope, might have trembled at the",OH

23138,terrible inadequacy of it to rise to the dignity of its endless chain of results.,OH

23139,"Afterward the priest spake briefly, as if by rote, of certain other civil and legal",OH

23140,"addenda that either might or should, at a later time, cap the ceremony. Lorison",OH

23141,"tendered a fee, which was declined, and before the door closed after the",OH

23142,departing couple Father Rogan's book popped open again where his finger,OH

23143,marked it.,OH

23144,"In the dark hall Norah whirled and clung to her companion, tearful.",OH

23145,"""Will you never, never be sorry?""",OH

23146,At last she was reassured.,OH

23147,"At the first light they reached upon the street, she asked the time, just as she",OH

23148,had each night. Lorison looked at his watch. Half-past eight.,OH

23149,Lorison thought it was from habit that she guided their steps toward the corner,OH

23150,"where they always parted. But, arrived there, she hesitated, and then released",OH

23151,"his arm. A drug store stood on the corner; its bright, soft light shone upon",OH

23152,them.,OH

23153,"""Please leave me here as usual to-night,"" said Norah, sweetly. ""I must�I",OH

23154,would rather you would. You will not object? At six to-morrow evening I will,OH

23155,meet you at Antonio's. I want to sit with you there once more. And then�I,OH

23156,"will go where you say."" She gave him a bewildering, bright smile, and walked",OH

23157,swiftly away.,OH

23158,Surely it needed all the strength of her charm to carry off this astounding,OH

23159,behaviour. It was no discredit to Lorison's strength of mind that his head began,OH

23160,"to whirl. Pocketing his hands, he rambled vacuously over to the druggist's",OH

23161,"windows, and began assiduously to spell over the names of the patent",OH

23162,medicines therein displayed.,OH

23163,"As soon as be had recovered his wits, he proceeded along the street in an",OH

23164,"aimless fashion. After drifting for two or three squares, he flowed into a",OH

23165,"somewhat more pretentious thoroughfare, a way much frequented by him in",OH

23166,his solitary ramblings. For here was a row of shops devoted to traffic in goods,OH

23167,"of the widest range of choice�handiworks of art, skill and fancy, products of",OH

23168,nature and labour from every zone.,OH

23169,"Here, for a time, he loitered among the conspicuous windows, where was set,",OH

23170,"emphasized by congested floods of light, the cunningest spoil of the interiors.",OH

23171,"There were few passers, and of this Lorison was glad. He was not of the",OH

23172,world. For a long time he had touched his fellow man only at the gear of a,OH

23173,"levelled cog-wheel�at right angles, and upon a different axis. He had dropped",OH

23174,"into a distinctly new orbit. The stroke of ill fortune had acted upon him, in",OH

23175,"effect, as a blow delivered upon the apex of a certain ingenious toy, the",OH

23176,"musical top, which, when thus buffeted while spinning, gives forth, with",OH

23177,"scarcely retarded motion, a complete change of key and chord.",OH

23178,"Strolling along the pacific avenue, he experienced singular, supernatural calm,",OH

23179,"accompanied by an unusual a activity of brain. Reflecting upon recent affairs,",OH

23180,he assured himself of his happiness in having won for a bride the one he had,OH

23181,"so greatly desired, yet he wondered mildly at his dearth of active emotion. Her",OH

23182,strange behaviour in abandoning him without valid excuse on his bridal eve,OH

23183,"aroused in him only a vague and curious speculation. Again, he found himself",OH

23184,"contemplating, with complaisant serenity, the incidents of her somewhat lively",OH

23185,career. His perspective seemed to have been queerly shifted.,OH

23186,"As he stood before a window near a corner, his ears were assailed by a waxing",OH

23187,clamour and commotion. He stood close to the window to allow passage to the,OH

23188,"cause of the hubbub�a procession of human beings, which rounded the",OH

23189,corner and headed in his direction. He perceived a salient hue of blue and a,OH

23190,"glitter of brass about a central figure of dazzling white and silver, and a ragged",OH

23191,"wake of black, bobbing figures.",OH

23192,Two ponderous policemen were conducting between them a woman dressed as,OH

23193,"if for the stage, in a short, white, satiny skirt reaching to the knees, pink",OH

23194,"stockings, and a sort of sleeveless bodice bright with relucent, armour-like",OH

23195,"scales. Upon her curly, light hair was perched, at a rollicking angle, a shining",OH

23196,tin helmet. The costume was to be instantly recognized as one of those,OH

23197,amazing conceptions to which competition has harried the inventors of the,OH

23198,"spectacular ballet. One of the officers bore a long cloak upon his arm, which,",OH

23199,"doubtless, had been intended to veil the I candid attractions of their effulgent",OH

23200,"prisoner, but, for some reason, it had not been called into use, to the vociferous",OH

23201,delight of the tail of the procession.,OH

23202,"Compelled by a sudden and vigorous movement of the woman, the parade",OH

23203,"halted before the window by which Lorison stood. He saw that she was young,",OH

23204,"and, at the first glance, was deceived by a sophistical prettiness of her face,",OH

23205,which waned before a more judicious scrutiny. Her look was bold and,OH

23206,"reckless, and upon her countenance, where yet the contours of youth survived,",OH

23207,"were the finger-marks of old age's credentialed courier, Late Hours.",OH

23208,"The young woman fixed her unshrinking gaze upon Lorison, and called to him",OH

23209,in the voice of the wronged heroine in straits:,OH

23210,"""Say! You look like a good fellow; come and put up the bail, won't you? I've",OH

23211,done nothing to get pinched for. It's all a mistake. See how they're treating me!,OH

23212,"You won't be sorry, if you'll help me out of this. Think of your sister or your",OH

23213,"girl being dragged along the streets this way! I say, come along now, like a",OH

23214,"good fellow.""",OH

23215,"It may be that Lorison, in spite of the unconvincing bathos of this appeal,",OH

23216,"showed a sympathetic face, for one of the officers left the woman's side, and",OH

23217,went over to him.,OH

23218,"""It's all right, Sir,"" he said, in a husky, confidential tone; ""she's the right party.",OH

23219,"We took her after the first act at the Green Light Theatre, on a wire from the",OH

23220,chief of police of Chicago. It's only a square or two to the station. Her rig's,OH

23221,"pretty bad, but she refused to change clothes�or, rather,"" added the officer,",OH

23222,"with a smile, ""to put on some. I thought I'd explain matters to you so you",OH

23223,"wouldn't think she was being imposed upon.""",OH

23224,"""What is the charge?"" asked Lorison.",OH

23225,"""Grand larceny. Diamonds. Her husband is a jeweller in Chicago. She cleaned",OH

23226,"his show case of the sparklers, and skipped with a comic-opera troupe.""",OH

23227,"The policeman, perceiving that the interest of the entire group of spectators",OH

23228,was centred upon himself and Lorison�their conference being regarded as a,OH

23229,possible new complication�was fain to prolong the situation�which,OH

23230,reflected his own importance�by a little afterpiece of philosophical comment.,OH

23231,"""A gentleman like you, Sir,"" he went on affably, ""would never notice it, but it",OH

23232,comes in my line to observe what an immense amount of trouble is made by,OH

23233,"that combination�I mean the stage, diamonds and light-headed women who",OH

23234,"aren't satisfied with good homes. I tell you, Sir, a man these days and nights",OH

23235,"wants to know what his women folks are up to.""",OH

23236,"The policeman smiled a good night, and returned to the side of his charge,",OH

23237,"who had been intently watching Lorison's face during the conversation, no",OH

23238,"doubt for some indication of his intention to render succour. Now, at the",OH

23239,"failure of the sign, and at the movement made to continue the ignominious",OH

23240,"progress, she abandoned hope, and addressed him thus, pointedly:",OH

23241,"""You damn chalk-faced quitter! You was thinking of giving me a hand, but",OH

23242,"you let the cop talk you out of it the first word. You're a dandy to tie to. Say, if",OH

23243,"you ever get a girl, she'll have a picnic. Won't she work you to the queen's",OH

23244,"taste! Oh, my!"" She concluded with a taunting, shrill laugh that rasped Lorison",OH

23245,like a saw. The policemen urged her forward; the delighted train of gaping,OH

23246,"followers closed up the rear; and the captive Amazon, accepting her fate,",OH

23247,extended the scope of her maledictions so that none in hearing might seem to,OH

23248,be slighted.,OH

23249,Then there came upon Lorison an overwhelming revulsion of his perspective.,OH

23250,"It may be that he had been ripe for it, that the abnormal condition of mind in",OH

23251,which he had for so long existed was already about to revert to its balance;,OH

23252,"however, it is certain that the events of the last few minutes had furnished the",OH

23253,"channel, if not the impetus, for the change.",OH

23254,The initial determining influence had been so small a thing as the fact and,OH

23255,"manner of his having been approached by the officer. That agent had, by the",OH

23256,"style of his accost, restored the loiterer to his former place in society. In an",OH

23257,instant he had been transformed from a somewhat rancid prowler along the,OH

23258,"fishy side streets of gentility into an honest gentleman, with whom even so",OH

23259,lordly a guardian of the peace might agreeably exchange the compliments.,OH

23260,"This, then, first broke the spell, and set thrilling in him a resurrected longing",OH

23261,"for the fellowship of his kind, and the rewards of the virtuous. To what end, he",OH

23262,"vehemently asked himself, was this fanciful self-accusation, this empty",OH

23263,"renunciation, this moral squeamishness through which he had been led to",OH

23264,"abandon what was his heritage in life, and not beyond his deserts? Technically,",OH

23265,"he was uncondemned; his sole guilty spot was in thought rather than deed, and",OH

23266,"cognizance of it unshared by others. For what good, moral or sentimental, did",OH

23267,"he slink, retreating like the hedgehog from his own shadow, to and fro in this",OH

23268,musty Bohemia that lacked even the picturesque?,OH

23269,But the thing that struck home and set him raging was the part played by the,OH

23270,Amazonian prisoner. To the counterpart of that astounding belligerent�,OH

23271,"identical at least, in the way of experience�to one, by her own confession,",OH

23272,"thus far fallen, had he, not three hours since, been united in marriage. How",OH

23273,"desirable and natural it had seemed to him then, and how monstrous it seemed",OH

23274,"now! How the words of diamond thief number two yet burned in his ears: ""If",OH

23275,"you ever get a girl, she'll have a picnic."" What did that mean but that women",OH

23276,"instinctively knew him for one they could hoodwink? Still again, there",OH

23277,"reverberated the policeman's sapient contribution to his agony: ""A man these",OH

23278,"days and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to."" Oh, yes, he",OH

23279,had been a fool; he had looked at things from the wrong standpoint.,OH

23280,"But the wildest note in all the clamour was struck by pain's forefinger,",OH

23281,"jealousy. Now, at least, he felt that keenest sting�a mounting love unworthily",OH

23282,"bestowed. Whatever she might be, he loved her; he bore in his own breast his",OH

23283,"doom. A grating, comic flavour to his predicament struck him suddenly, and",OH

23284,he laughed creakingly as he swung down the echoing pavement. An impetuous,OH

23285,"desire to act, to battle with his fate, seized him. He stopped upon his heel, and",OH

23286,smote his palms together triumphantly. His wife was�where? But there was a,OH

23287,"tangible link; an outlet more or less navigable, through which his derelict ship",OH

23288,of matrimony might yet be safely towed�the priest!,OH

23289,"Like all imaginative men with pliable natures, Lorison was, when thoroughly",OH

23290,"stirred, apt to become tempestuous. With a high and stubborn indignation upon",OH

23291,"him, be retraced his steps to the intersecting street by which he had come.",OH

23292,Down this he hurried to the corner where he had parted with�an astringent,OH

23293,"grimace tinctured the thought�his wife. Thence still back he harked,",OH

23294,following through an unfamiliar district his stimulated recollections of the way,OH

23295,"they had come from that preposterous wedding. Many times he went abroad,",OH

23296,"and nosed his way back to the trail, furious.",OH

23297,"At last, when he reached the dark, calamitous building in which his madness",OH

23298,"had culminated, and found the black hallway, he dashed down it, perceiving",OH

23299,"no light or sound. But he raised his voice, hailing loudly; reckless of",OH

23300,everything but that he should find the old mischief-maker with the eyes that,OH

23301,"looked too far away to see the disaster he had wrought. The door opened, and",OH

23302,"in the stream of light Father Rogan stood, his book in hand, with his finger",OH

23303,marking the place.,OH

23304,"""Ah!"" cried Lorison. ""You are the man I want. I had a wife of you a few hours",OH

23305,"ago. I would not trouble you, but I neglected to note how it was done. Will you",OH

23306,"oblige me with the information whether the business is beyond remedy?""",OH

23307,"""Come inside,"" said the priest; ""there are other lodgers in the house, who",OH

23308,"might prefer sleep to even a gratified curiosity.""",OH

23309,Lorison entered the room and took the chair offered him. The priest's eyes,OH

23310,looked a courteous interrogation.,OH

23311,"""I must apologize again,"" said the young man, ""for so soon intruding upon you",OH

23312,"with my marital infelicities, but, as my wife has neglected to furnish me with",OH

23313,"her address, I am deprived of the legitimate recourse of a family row.""",OH

23314,"""I am quite a plain man,"" said Father Rogan, pleasantly; ""but I do not see how",OH

23315,"I am to ask you questions.""",OH

23316,"""Pardon my indirectness,"" said Lorison; ""I will ask one. In this room to-night",OH

23317,you pronounced me to be a husband. You afterward spoke of additional rites,OH

23318,or performances that either should or could be effected. I paid little attention to,OH

23319,"your words then, but I am hungry to hear them repeated now. As matters",OH

23320,"stand, am I married past all help?""",OH

23321,"""You are as legally and as firmly bound,"" said the priest, ""as though it had",OH

23322,"been done in a cathedral, in the presence of thousands. The additional",OH

23323,"observances I referred to are not necessary to the strictest legality of the act,",OH

23324,but were advised as a precaution for the future�for convenience of proof in,OH

23325,"such contingencies as wills, inheritances and the like.""",OH

23326,Lorison laughed harshly.,OH

23327,"""Many thanks,"" he said. ""Then there is no mistake, and I am the happy",OH

23328,"benedict. I suppose I should go stand upon the bridal corner, and when my",OH

23329,"wife gets through walking the streets she will look me up.""",OH

23330,Father Rogan regarded him calmly.,OH

23331,"""My son,"" he said, ""when a man and woman come to me to be married I",OH

23332,always marry them. I do this for the sake of other people whom they might go,OH

23333,"away and marry if they did not marry each other. As you see, I do not seek",OH

23334,your confidence; but your case seems to me to be one not altogether devoid of,OH

23335,interest. Very few marriages that have come to my notice have brought such,OH

23336,well-expressed regret within so short a time. I will hazard one question: were,OH

23337,"you not under the impression that you loved the lady you married, at the time",OH

23338,"you did so;""",OH

23339,"""Loved her!"" cried Lorison, wildly. ""Never so well as now, though she told me",OH

23340,"she deceived and sinned and stole. Never more than now, when, perhaps, she",OH

23341,"is laughing at the fool she cajoled and left, with scarcely a word, to return to",OH

23342,"God only knows what particular line of her former folly.""",OH

23343,"Father Rogan answered nothing. During the silence that succeeded, he sat with",OH

23344,"a quiet expectation beaming in his full, lambent eye.",OH

23345,"""If you would listen�"" began Lorison. The priest held up his hand.",OH

23346,"""As I hoped,"" he said. ""I thought you would trust me. Wait but a moment."" He",OH

23347,"brought a long clay pipe, filled and lighted it.",OH

23348,"""Now, my son,"" he said.",OH

23349,Lorison poured a twelve month's accumulated confidence into Father Rogan's,OH

23350,"ear. He told all; not sparing himself or omitting the facts of his past, the events",OH

23351,"of the night, or his disturbing conjectures and fears.",OH

23352,"""The main point,"" said the priest, when he had concluded, ""seems to me to be",OH

23353,this�are you reasonably sure that you love this woman whom you have,OH

23354,"married?""",OH

23355,"""Why,"" exclaimed Lorison, rising impulsively to his feet�""why should I deny",OH

23356,"it? But look at me�am fish, flesh or fowl? That is the main point to me, I",OH

23357,"assure you.""",OH

23358,"""I understand you,"" said the priest, also rising, and laying down his pipe. ""The",OH

23359,situation is one that has taxed the endurance of much older men than you�in,OH

23360,"fact, especially much older men than you. I will try to relieve you from it, and",OH

23361,this night. You shall see for yourself into exactly what predicament you have,OH

23362,"fallen, and how you shall, possibly, be extricated. There is no evidence so",OH

23363,"credible as that of the eyesight.""",OH

23364,"Father Rogan moved about the room, and donned a soft black hat. Buttoning",OH

23365,"his coat to his throat, he laid his hand on the doorknob. ""Let us walk,"" he said.",OH

23366,"The two went out upon the street. The priest turned his face down it, and",OH

23367,"Lorison walked with him through a squalid district, where the houses loomed,",OH

23368,"awry and desolate-looking, high above them. Presently they turned into a less",OH

23369,"dismal side street, where the houses were smaller, and, though hinting of the",OH

23370,"most meagre comfort, lacked the concentrated wretchedness of the more",OH

23371,populous byways.,OH

23372,"At a segregated, two-story house Father Rogan halted, and mounted the steps",OH

23373,with the confidence of a familiar visitor. He ushered Lorison into a narrow,OH

23374,"hallway, faintly lighted by a cobwebbed hanging lamp. Almost immediately a",OH

23375,door to the right opened and a dingy Irishwoman protruded her head.,OH

23376,"""Good evening to ye, Mistress Geehan,"" said the priest, unconsciously, it",OH

23377,"seemed, falling into a delicately flavoured brogue. ""And is it yourself can tell",OH

23378,"me if Norah has gone out again, the night, maybe?""",OH

23379,"""Oh, it's yer blissid riverence! Sure and I can tell ye the same. The purty",OH

23380,"darlin' wint out, as usual, but a bit later. And she says: 'Mother Geehan,' says",OH

23381,"she, 'it's me last noight out, praise the saints, this noight is!' And, oh, yer",OH

23382,"riverence, the swate, beautiful drame of a dress she had this toime! White satin",OH

23383,"and silk and ribbons, and lace about the neck and arrums�'twas a sin, yer",OH

23384,"reverence, the gold was spint upon it.""",OH

23385,"The priest heard Lorison catch his breath painfully, and a faint smile flickered",OH

23386,across his own clean-cut mouth.,OH

23387,"""Well, then, Mistress Geehan,"" said he, ""I'll just step upstairs and see the bit",OH

23388,"boy for a minute, and I'll take this gentleman up with me.""",OH

23389,"""He's awake, thin,"" said the woman. 'I've just come down from sitting wid him",OH

23391,"gossoon, it is, yer riverence, for me shtories.""",OH

23392,"""Small the doubt,"" said Father Rogan. ""There's no rocking would put him to",OH

23393,"slape the quicker, I'm thinking.""",OH

23394,"Amid the woman's shrill protest against the retort, the two men ascended the",OH

23395,steep stairway. The priest pushed open the door of a room near its top.,OH

23396,"""Is that you already, sister?"" drawled a sweet, childish voice from the",OH

23397,darkness.,OH

23398,"""It's only ould Father Denny come to see ye, darlin'; and a foine gentleman",OH

23402,"It's on the table by the door. And quit talking like Mother Geehan, Father",OH

23403,"Denny.""",OH

23404,"The priest lit the lamp, and Lorison saw a tiny, towsled-haired boy, with a thin,",OH

23405,"delicate face, sitting up in a small bed in a corner. Quickly, also, his rapid",OH

23406,glance considered the room and its contents. It was furnished with more than,OH

23407,"comfort, and its adornments plainly indicated a woman's discerning taste. An",OH

23408,open door beyond revealed the blackness of an adjoining room's interior.,OH

23409,"The boy clutched both of Father Rogan's hands. ""I'm so glad you came,"" he",OH

23410,"said; ""but why did you come in the night? Did sister send you?""",OH

23411,"""Off wid ye! Am I to be sint about, at me age, as was Terence McShane, of",OH

23412,"Ballymahone? I come on me own r-r-responsibility.""",OH

23413,Lorison had also advanced to the boy's bedside. He was fond of children; and,OH

23414,"the wee fellow, laying himself down to sleep alone in that dark room, stirredhis heart.",OH

23415,"""Aren't you afraid, little man?"" he asked, stooping down beside him.",OH

23416,"""Sometimes,"" answered the boy, with a shy smile, ""when the rats make too",OH

23417,"much noise. But nearly every night, when sister goes out, Mother Geehan",OH

23418,"stays a while with me, and tells me funny stories. I'm not often afraid, sir.""",OH

23419,"""This brave little gentleman,"" said Father Rogan, ""is a scholar of mine. Every",OH

23420,day from half-past six to half-past eight�when sister comes for him�he,OH

23421,"stops in my study, and we find out what's in the inside of books. He knows",OH

23422,"multiplication, division and fractions; and he's troubling me to begin wid the",OH

23423,"chronicles of Ciaran of Clonmacnoise, Corurac McCullenan and Cuan",OH

23424,"O'Lochain, the gr-r-reat Irish histhorians."" The boy was evidently accustomed",OH

23425,"to the priest's Celtic pleasantries. A little, appreciative grin was all the",OH

23426,attention the insinuation of pedantry received.,OH

23427,"Lorison, to have saved his life, could not have put to the child one of those",OH

23428,"vital questions that were wildly beating about, unanswered, in his own brain.",OH

23429,The little fellow was very like Norah; he had the same shining hair and candid,OH

23430,eyes.,OH

23431,"""Oh, Father Denny,"" cried the boy, suddenly, ""I forgot to tell you! Sister is not",OH

23432,going away at night any more! She told me so when she kissed me good night,OH

23433,"as she was leaving. And she said she was so happy, and then she cried. Wasn't",OH

23434,"that queer? But I'm glad; aren't you?""",OH

23435,"""Yes, lad. And now, ye omadhaun, go to sleep, and say good night; we must be",OH

23436,"going.""",OH

23437,"""Which shall I do first, Father Denny?""",OH

23438,"""Faith, he's caught me again! Wait till I get the sassenach into the annals of",OH

23439,"Tageruach, the hagiographer; I'll give him enough of the Irish idiom to make",OH

23440,"him more respectful.""",OH

23441,"The light was out, and the small, brave voice bidding them good night from",OH

23442,"the dark room. They groped downstairs, and tore away from the garrulity of",OH

23443,Mother Geehan.,OH

23444,"Again the priest steered them through the dim ways, but this time in another",OH

23445,"direction. His conductor was serenely silent, and Lorison followed his",OH

23446,example to the extent of seldom speaking. Serene he could not be. His heart,OH

23447,"beat suffocatingly in his breast. The following of this blind, menacing trail was",OH

23448,pregnant with he knew not what humiliating revelation to be delivered at its,OH

23449,end.,OH

23450,"They came into a more pretentious street, where trade, it could be surmised,",OH

23451,flourished by day. And again the priest paused; this time before a lofty,OH

23452,"building, whose great doors and windows in the lowest floor were carefully",OH

23453,"shuttered and barred. Its higher apertures were dark, save in the third story, the",OH

23454,"windows of which were brilliantly lighted. Lorison's ear caught a distant,",OH

23455,"regular, pleasing thrumming, as of music above. They stood at an angle of the",OH

23456,"building. Up, along the side nearest them, mounted an iron stairway. At its top",OH

23457,"was an upright, illuminated parallelogram. Father Rogan had stopped, and",OH

23458,"stood, musing.",OH

23459,"""I will say this much,"" he remarked, thoughtfully: ""I believe you to be a better",OH

23460,"man than you think yourself to be, and a better man than I thought some hours",OH

23461,"ago. But do not take this,"" he added, with a smile, ""as much praise. I promised",OH

23462,you a possible deliverance from an unhappy perplexity. I will have to modify,OH

23463,that promise. I can only remove the mystery that enhanced that perplexity.,OH

23464,"Your deliverance depends upon yourself. Come.""",OH

23465,"He led his companion up the stairway. Halfway up, Lorison caught him by the",OH

23466,"sleeve. ""Remember,"" he gasped, ""I love that woman.""",OH

23467,"""You desired to know.",OH

23468,"""I�Go on.""",OH

23469,"The priest reached the landing at the top of the stairway. Lorison, behind him,",OH

23470,saw that the illuminated space was the glass upper half of a door opening into,OH

23471,the lighted room. The rhythmic music increased as they neared it; the stairs,OH

23472,shook with the mellow vibrations.,OH

23473,"Lorison stopped breathing when he set foot upon the highest step, for the",OH

23474,"priest stood aside, and motioned him to look through the glass of the door.",OH

23475,"His eye, accustomed to the darkness, met first a blinding glare, and then he",OH

23476,"made out the faces and forms of many people, amid an extravagant display of",OH

23477,"splendid robings�billowy laces, brilliant-hued finery, ribbons, silks and misty",OH

23478,"drapery. And then he caught the meaning of that jarring hum, and he saw the",OH

23479,"tired, pale, happy face of his wife, bending, as were a score of others, over her",OH

23480,"sewing machine�toiling, toiling. Here was the folly she pursued, and the end",OH

23481,of his quest.,OH

23482,"But not his deliverance, though even then remorse struck him. His shamed",OH

23483,soul fluttered once more before it retired to make room for the other and better,OH

23484,"one. For, to temper his thrill of joy, the shine of the satin and the glimmer of",OH

23485,"ornaments recalled the disturbing figure of the bespangled Amazon, and the",OH

23486,base duplicate histories lit by the glare of footlights and stolen diamonds. It is,OH

23487,"past the wisdom of him who only sets the scenes, either to praise or blame the",OH

23488,"man. But this time his love overcame his scruples. He took a quick step, and",OH

23489,reached out his hand for the doorknob. Father Rogan was quicker to arrest it,OH

23490,and draw him back.,OH

23491,"""You use my trust in you queerly,"" said the priest sternly. ""What are you about",OH

23492,"to do?""",OH

23493,"""I am going to my wife,"" said Lorison. ""Let me pass.""",OH

23494,"""Listen,"" said the priest, holding him firmly by the arm. ""I am about to put you",OH

23495,"in possession of a piece of knowledge of which, thus far, you have scarcely",OH

23496,proved deserving. I do not think you ever will; but I will not dwell upon that.,OH

23497,"You see in that room the woman you married, working for a frugal living for",OH

23498,"herself, and a generous comfort for an idolized brother. This building belongs",OH

23499,to the chief costumer of the city. For months the advance orders for the,OH

23500,coming Mardi Gras festivals have kept the work going day and night. I myself,OH

23501,secured employment here for Norah. She toils here each night from nine,OH

23502,"o'clock until daylight, and, besides, carries home with her some of the finer",OH

23503,"costumes, requiring more delicate needlework, and works there part of the day.",OH

23504,"Somehow, you two have remained strangely ignorant of each other's lives. Are",OH

23505,"you convinced now that your wife is not walking the streets?""",OH

23506,"""Let me go to her,"" cried Lorison, again struggling, ""and beg her forgiveness!'",OH

23507,"""Sir,"" said the priest, ""do you owe me nothing? Be quiet. It seems so often that",OH

23508,Heaven lets fall its choicest gifts into hands that must be taught to hold them.,OH

23509,"Listen again. You forgot that repentant sin must not compromise, but look up,",OH

23510,"for redemption, to the purest and best. You went to her with the fine-spun",OH

23511,"sophistry that peace could be found in a mutual guilt; and she, fearful of losing",OH

23512,"what her heart so craved, thought it worth the price to buy it with a desperate,",OH

23513,"pure, beautiful lie. I have known her since the day she was born; she is as",OH

23514,innocent and unsullied in life and deed as a holy saint. In that lowly street,OH

23515,"where she dwells she first saw the light, and she has lived there ever since,",OH

23516,"spending her days in generous self-sacrifice for others. Och, ye spalpeen!""",OH

23517,"continued Father Rogan, raising his finger in kindly anger at Lorison. ""What",OH

23518,"for, I wonder, could she be after making a fool of hersilf, and shamin' her",OH

23519,"swate soul with lies, for the like of you!""",OH

23520,"""Sir,"" said Lorison, trembling, ""say what you please of me. Doubt it as you",OH

23521,"must, I will yet prove my gratitude to you, and my devotion to her. But let me",OH

23522,"speak to her once now, let me kneel for just one moment at her feet, and�""",OH

23523,"""Tut, tut!"" said the priest. ""How many acts of a love drama do you think an old",OH

23524,"bookworm like me capable of witnessing? Besides, what kind of figures do we",OH

23525,"cut, spying upon the mysteries of midnight millinery! Go to meet your wife tomorrow, as she ordered you, and obey her thereafter, and maybe some time I",OH

23526,shall get forgiveness for the part I have played in this night's work. Off wid,OH

23618,"""The problem solves itself, auntie,"" she cried. ""I'm going to that ranch. I'm",OH

23621,"a new life that comes when my old one is just ending. It's a release, auntie; it",OH

23650,seemed to have been hastily constructed of undressed lumber and flapping,OH

23651,"canvas. The element that had congregated about the station, though not",OH

23672,"He perceived Octavia at almost the same time, deflected his course, and",OH

23673,"steered for her in his old, straightforward way. Something like awe came upon",OH

23674,her as the strangeness of his metamorphosis was brought into closer range; the,OH

23675,"rich, red-brown of his complexion brought out so vividly his straw-coloured",OH

23676,"mustache and steel-gray eyes. He seemed more grown-up, and, somehow,",OH

23677,"farther away. But, when he spoke, the old, boyish Teddy came back again.",OH

23714,world carpeted with an endless reach of curly mesquite grass. The wheels,OH

23715,made no sound. The tireless ponies bounded ahead at an unbroken gallop. The,OH

23717,"flowers, roared gloriously in their ears. The motion was a�rial, ecstatic, with a",OH

23718,"thrilling sense of perpetuity in its effect. Octavia sat silent, possessed by a",OH

23719,"feeling of elemental, sensual bliss. Teddy seemed to be wrestling with some",OH

23720,internal problem.,OH

23730,"""Jack-rabbit,"" said Teddy, without turning his head.",OH

23732,and the eye of an eager child.,OH

23733,"""On one condition. Could I�might I smoke?""",OH

23744,"""Now, I'll ask you,"" protested Teddy, who was futilely striking match after",OH

23769,"""It's easily explained in my case,"" responded Teddy, promptly. ""I had to go to",OH

23770,"work. I couldn't have earned my board in New York, so I chummed a while",OH

23771,"with old Sandford, one of the syndicate that owned the ranch before Colonel",OH

23772,"Beaupree bought it, and got a place down here. I wasn't manager at first. I",OH

23773,"jogged around on ponies and studied the business in detail, until I got all the",OH

23774,"points in my head. I saw where it was losing and what the remedies were, and",OH

23775,"then Sandford put me in charge. I get a hundred dollars a month, and I earn it.""",OH

23776,"""Poor Teddy!"" said Octavia, with a smile.",OH

23777,"""You needn't. I like it. I save half my wages, and I'm as hard as a water plug. It",OH

23779,"""Will it furnish bread and tea and jam for another outcast from civilization?""",OH

23781,business. Wastefulness and inattention have been the rule heretofore. The,OH

23784,"When, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the ponies rounded a gentle, brushcovered hill, and then swooped, like a double cream-coloured cyclone, upon",OH

23786,"of magnificent live-oaks cast an area of grateful, cool shade, whence the ranch",OH

23787,"had drawn its name, ""de las Sombras""�of the shadows. The house, of red",OH

23790,"picturesque with flowering cactus and hanging red earthern jars. A ""gallery,""",OH

23791,"low and broad, encircled the building. Vines climbed about it, and the adjacent",OH

23792,"ground was, for a space, covered with transplanted grass and shrubs. A little",OH

23793,"lake, long and narrow, glimmered in the sun at the rear. Further away stood the",OH

23794,"shacks of the Mexican workers, the corrals, wool sheds and shearing pens. To",OH

23795,"the right lay the low hills, splattered with dark patches of chaparral; to the left",OH

23808,"""Oh, Mrs. MacIntyre, don't apologize for Teddy. Yes, I call him Teddy. So",OH

23815,"there was nothing in his ingenuous, weather-tanned face to warrant a suspicion",OH

23816,"that he was making an allusion�nothing. Beyond a doubt, thought Octavia, he",OH

23817,had forgotten.,OH

23822,Two rooms at the east end of the house had been arranged for the occupancy,OH

23823,of the ranch's mistress. When she entered them a slight dismay seized her at,OH

23824,their bare appearance and the scantiness of their furniture; but she quickly,OH

23825,"reflected that the climate was a semi-tropical one, and was moved to",OH

23826,appreciation of the well-conceived efforts to conform to it. The sashes had,OH

23827,"already been removed from the big windows, and white curtains waved in the",OH

23828,Gulf breeze that streamed through the wide jalousies. The bare floor was,OH

23829,"amply strewn with cool rugs; the chairs were inviting, deep, dreamy willows;",OH

23830,"the walls were papered with a light, cheerful olive. One whole side of her",OH

23831,"sitting room was covered with books on smooth, unpainted pine shelves. She",OH

23832,flew to these at once. Before her was a well-selected library. She caught,OH

23833,glimpses of titles of volumes of fiction and travel not yet seasoned from the,OH

23834,dampness of the press.,OH

23835,"Presently, recollecting that she was now in a wilderness given over to mutton,",OH

23840,"Octavia, fatigued by her long journey, retired early that night. Lying upon her",OH

23872,"love-making, of fanciful, quixotic devotion, of heart-breaking gloom, of",OH

23873,"alternating, absurd tenderness and haughty dignity? His nature had been a",OH

23887,originated one night at the Hammersmiths' ball. It occurred at a time soon after,OH

23888,"she had decided to accept Colonel Beaupree and his million, which was no",OH

23889,more than her looks and the entr�e she held to the inner circles were worth.,OH

23890,"Teddy had proposed with all his impetuosity and fire, and she looked him",OH

23891,"straight in the eyes, an said, coldly and finally: ""Never let me hear any such",OH

23892,"silly nonsense from you again."" ""You won't,"" said Teddy, with an expression",OH

23893,"around his mouth, and�now Teddy was inclosed within a strong barbed-wire",OH

23894,fence.,OH

23895,It was on this first ride of inspection that Teddy was seized by the inspiration,OH

23896,"that suggested the name of Mother Goose's heroine, and he at once bestowed it",OH

23897,"upon Octavia. The idea, supported by both a similarity of names and identity",OH

23898,"of occupations, seemed to strike him as a peculiarly happy one, and he never",OH

23899,"tired of using it. The Mexicans on the ranch also took up the name, adding",OH

23900,"another syllable to accommodate their lingual incapacity for the final ""p,""",OH

23901,"gravely referring to her as ""La Madama Bo-Peepy."" Eventually it spread, and",OH

23902,"""Madame Bo-Peep's ranch"" was as often mentioned as the ""Rancho de las",OH

23904,"Came the long, hot season from May to September, when work is scarce on",OH

23905,"the ranches. Octavia passed the days in a kind of lotus-eater's dream. Books,",OH

23906,"hammocks, correspondence with a few intimate friends, a renewed interest in",OH

23907,her old water-colour box and easel�these disposed of the sultry hours of,OH

23908,daylight. The evenings were always sure to bring enjoyment. Best of all were,OH

23909,"the rapturous horseback rides with Teddy, when the moon gave light over the",OH

23910,"wind-swept leagues, chaperoned by the wheeling night-hawk and the startled",OH

23911,owl. Often the Mexicans would come up from their shacks with their guitars,OH

23912,"and sing the weirdest of heart-breaking songs. There were long, cosy chats on",OH

23913,"the breezy gallery, and an interminable warfare of wits between Teddy and",OH

23914,"Mrs. MacIntyre, whose abundant Scotch shrewdness often more than",OH

23915,overmatched the lighter humour in which she was lacking.,OH

23916,"And the nights came, one after another, and were filed away by weeks and",OH

23917,"months�nights soft and languorous and fragrant, that should have driven",OH

23918,"Strephon to Chloe over wires however barbed, that might have drawn Cupid",OH

23919,"himself to hunt, lasso in hand, among those amorous pastures�but Teddy kept",OH

23920,his fences up.,OH

23921,One July night Madame Bo-Peep and her ranch manager were sitting on the,OH

23922,east gallery. Teddy had been exhausting the science of prognostication as to,OH

23923,"the probabilities of a price of twenty-four cents for the autumn clip, and had",OH

23924,then subsided into an anesthetic cloud of Havana smoke. Only as incompetent,OH

23925,a judge as a woman would have failed to note long ago that at least a third of,OH

23926,his salary must have gone up in the fumes of those imported Regalias.,OH

23927,"""Teddy,"" said Octavia, suddenly, and rather sharply, ""what are you working",OH

23928,"down here on a ranch for?""",OH

23929,"""One hundred per,"" said Teddy, glibly, ""and found.""",OH

23930,"""I've a good mind to discharge you.""",OH

23931,"""Can't do it,"" said Teddy, with a grin.",OH

23932,"""Why not?"" demanded Octavia, with argumentative heat.",OH

23933,"""Under contract. Terms of sale respect all unexpired contracts. Mine runs until",OH

23934,"12 P. M., December thirty-first. You might get up at midnight on that date and",OH

23935,"fire me. If you try it sooner I'll be in a position to bring legal proceedings.""",OH

23936,Octavia seemed to be considering the prospects of litigation.,OH

23937,"""But,"" continued Teddy cheerfully, ""I've been thinking of resigning anyway.""",OH

23938,Octavia's rocking-chair ceased its motion. There were centipedes in this,OH

23939,"country, she felt sure; and Indians, and vast, lonely, desolate, empty wastes; all",OH

23940,"within strong barbed-wire fence. There was a Van Dresser pride, but there was",OH

23941,also a Van Dresser heart. She must know for certain whether or not he had,OH

23942,forgotten.,OH

23943,"""Ah, well, Teddy,"" she said, with a fine assumption of polite interest, ""it's",OH

23944,lonely down here; you're longing to get back to the old life�to polo and,OH

23945,"lobsters and theatres and balls.""",OH

23946,"""Never cared much for balls,"" said Teddy virtuously.",OH

23948,"miss a dance, unless it occurred on the same night with another one which you",OH

23949,"attended. And you showed such shocking bad taste, too, in dancing too often",OH

23950,"with the same partner. Let me see, what was that Forbes girl's name�the one",OH

23951,"with wall eyes�Mabel, wasn't it?""",OH

23952,"""No; Ad�le. Mabel was the one with the bony elbows. That wasn't wall in",OH

23957,"""Hammersmiths' what?"" questioned Teddy, vacuously.",OH

23958,"""Ball�ball,"" said Octavia, viciously. ""What were we talking of?""",OH

23959,"""Eyes, I thought,"" said Teddy, after some reflection; ""and elbows.""",OH

23965,"ball was dreadfully overdone.""",OH

23966,"""It was,"" said Teddy.",OH

23967,"""Such a crowd there was!"" Octavia continued, conscious that she was talking",OH

23968,"the rapid drivel of a school-girl describing her first dance. ""The balconies were",OH

23969,"as warm as the rooms. I�lost�something at that ball."" The last sentence was",OH

23970,uttered in a tone calculated to remove the barbs from miles of wire.,OH

23971,"""So did I,"" confessed Teddy, in a lower voice.",OH

23972,"""A glove,"" said Octavia, falling back as the enemy approached her ditches.",OH

23973,"""Caste,"" said Teddy, halting his firing line without loss. ""I hobnobbed, half the",OH

23974,"evening with one of Hammersmith's miners, a fellow who kept his hands in",OH

23975,"his pockets, and talked like an archangel about reduction plants and drifts and",OH

23976,"levels and sluice-boxes.""",OH

23977,"""A pearl-gray glove, nearly new,"" sighed Octavia, mournfully.",OH

23978,"""A bang-up chap, that McArdle,"" maintained Teddy approvingly. ""A man who",OH

23979,"hated olives and elevators; a man who handled mountains as croquettes, and",OH

23980,built tunnels in the air; a man who never uttered a word of silly nonsense in his,OH

23981,"life. Did you sign those lease-renewal applications yet, madama? They've got",OH

23982,"to be on file in the land office by the thirty-first.""",OH

23983,Teddy turned his head lazily. Octavia's chair was vacant.,OH

23984,"A certain centipede, crawling along the lines marked out by fate, expounded",OH

23985,the situation. It was early one morning while Octavia and Mrs. Maclntyre were,OH

23986,trimming the honeysuckle on the west gallery. Teddy had risen and departed,OH

23987,hastily before daylight in response to word that a flock of ewes had been,OH

23988,scattered from their bedding ground during the night by a thunder-storm.,OH

23989,"The centipede, driven by destiny, showed himself on the floor of the gallery,",OH

23990,"and then, the screeches of the two women giving him his cue, he scuttled with",OH

23991,"all his yellow legs through the open door into the furthermost west room,",OH

23992,which was Teddy's. Arming themselves with domestic utensils selected with,OH

23993,"regard to their length, Octavia and Mrs. Maclntyre, with much clutching of",OH

23994,"skirts and skirmishing for the position of rear guard in the attacking force,",OH

23995,followed.,OH

23996,"Once outside, the centipede seemed to have disappeared, and his prospective",OH

23997,murderers began a thorough but cautious search for their victim.,OH

23998,Even in the midst of such a dangerous and absorbing adventure Octavia was,OH

23999,conscious of an awed curiosity on finding herself in Teddy's sanctum. In that,OH

24000,"room he sat alone, silently communing with those secret thoughts that he now",OH

24001,"shared with no one, dreamed there whatever dreams he now called on no one",OH

24002,to interpret.,OH

24003,"It was the room of a Spartan or a soldier. In one corner stood a wide, canvascovered cot; in another, a small bookcase; in another, a grim stand of",OH

24004,"Winchesters and shotguns. An immense table, strewn with letters, papers and",OH

24005,"documents and surmounted by a set of pigeon-holes, occupied one side.",OH

24006,The centipede showed genius in concealing himself in such bare quarters. Mrs.,OH

24007,Maclntyre was poking a broom-handle behind the bookcase. Octavia,OH

24008,approached Teddy's cot. The room was just as the manager had left it in his,OH

24009,hurry. The Mexican maid had not yet given it her attention. There was his big,OH

24010,pillow with the imprint of his head still in the centre. She thought the horrid,OH

24011,beast might have climbed the cot and hidden itself to bite Teddy. Centipedes,OH

24012,were thus cruel and vindictive toward managers.,OH

24013,"She cautiously overturned the pillow, and then parted her lips to give the",OH

24014,"signal for reinforcements at sight of a long, slender, dark object lying there.",OH

24015,"But, repressing it in time, she caught up a glove, a pearl-gray glove, flattened",OH

24016,"�it might be conceived�by many, many months of nightly pressure beneath",OH

24017,the pillow of the man who had forgotten the Hammersmiths' ball. Teddy must,OH

24018,"have left so hurriedly that morning that he had, for once, forgotten to transfer",OH

24019,"it to its resting-place by day. Even managers, who are notoriously wily and",OH

24020,"cunning, are sometimes caught up with.",OH

24021,Octavia slid the gray glove into the bosom of her summery morning gown. It,OH

24022,"was hers. Men who put themselves within a strong barbed-wire fence, and",OH

24023,"remember Hammersmith balls only by the talk of miners about sluice-boxes,",OH

24024,should not be allowed to possess such articles.,OH

24025,"After all, what a paradise this prairie country was! How it blossomed like the",OH

24026,rose when you found things that were thought to be lost! How delicious was,OH

24027,"that morning breeze coming in the windows, fresh and sweet with the breath",OH

24028,"of the yellow ratama blooms! Might one not stand, for a minute, with shining,",OH

24029,"far-gazing eyes, and dream that mistakes might be corrected?",OH

24030,Why was Mrs. Maclntyre poking about so absurdly with a broom?,OH

24031,"""I've found it,"" said Mrs. MacIntyre, banging the door. ""Here it is.""",OH

24032,"""Did you lose something? asked Octavia, with sweetly polite non-interest.",OH

24033,"""The little devil!"" said Mrs. Maclntyre, driven to violence. ""Ye've no forgotten",OH

24034,"him alretty?""",OH

24035,Between them they slew the centipede. Thus was he rewarded for his agency,OH

24036,toward the recovery of things lost at the Hammersmiths' ball.,OH

24037,"It seems that Teddy, in due course, remembered the glove, and when he",OH

24038,returned to the house at sunset made a secret but exhaustive search for it. Not,OH

24039,"until evening, upon the moonlit eastern gallery, did he find it. It was upon the",OH

24040,"hand that he had thought lost to him forever, and so he was moved to repeat",OH

24041,"certain nonsense that he had been commanded never, never to utter again.",OH

24042,Teddy's fences were down.,OH

24043,"This time there was no ambition to stand in the way, and the wooing was as",OH

24044,natural and successful as should be between ardent shepherd and gentle,OH

24045,shepherdess.,OH

24046,The prairies changed to a garden. The Rancho de las Sombras became the,OH

24047,Ranch of Light.,OH

24048,"A few days later Octavia received a letter from Mr. Bannister, in reply to one",OH

24049,she had written to him asking some questions about her business. A portion of,OH

24050,the letter ran as follows:,OH

24051,"""I am at a loss to account for your references to the sheep ranch. Two",OH

24052,"months after your departure to take up your residence upon it, it was",OH

24053,discovered that Colonel Beaupree's title was worthless. A deed came to light,OH

24054,showing that he disposed of the property before his death. The matter was,OH

24055,"reported to your manager, Mr. Westlake, who at once repurchased the property.",OH

24056,It is entirely beyond my powers of conjecture to imagine how you have,OH

24057,remained in ignorance of this fact. I beg that you that will at once confer with,OH

24058,"that gentleman, who will, at least, corroborate my statement.""",OH

24059,"Octavia sought Teddy, with battle in her eye.",OH

24060,"""What are you working on this ranch for?"" she asked once more.",OH

24061,"""One hundred�"" he began to repeat, but saw in her face that she knew. She",OH

24062,held Mr. Bannister's letter in her hand. He knew that the game was up.,OH

24063,"""It's my ranch,"" said Teddy, like a schoolboy detected in evil. ""It's a mighty",OH

24064,poor manager that isn't able to absorb the boss's business if you give him,OH

24065,"time.""",OH

24066,"""Why were you working down here?"" pursued Octavia still struggling after the",OH

24067,key to the riddle of Teddy.,OH

24068,"""To tell the truth, 'Tave,"" said Teddy, with quiet candour, ""it wasn't for the",OH

24069,salary. That about kept me in cigars and sunburn lotions. I was sent south by,OH

24070,my doctor. 'Twas that right lung that was going to the bad on account of overexercise and strain at polo and gymnastics. I needed climate and ozone and,OH

24071,"rest and things of that sort.""",OH

24072,In an instant Octavia was close against the vicinity of the affected organ. Mr.,OH

24073,Bannister's letter fluttered to the floor.,OH

24074,"""It's�it's well now, isn't it, Teddy?""",OH

24075,"""Sound as a mesquite chunk. I deceived you in one thing. I paid fifty thousand",OH

24101,[TO MARGARET LADY BROOKE - THE RANEE OF SARAWAK],OW

24102,"It was the night before the day fixed for his coronation, and the young King",OW

24103,was sitting alone in his beautiful chamber. His courtiers had all taken their,OW

24104,"leave of him, bowing their heads to the ground, according to the ceremonious",OW

24105,"usage of the day, and had retired to the Great Hall of the Palace, to receive a",OW

24106,few last lessons from the Professor of Etiquette; there being some of them who,OW

24107,"had still quite natural manners, which in a courtier is, I need hardly say, a very",OW

24108,grave offence.,OW

24109,"The lad - for he was only a lad, being but sixteen years of age - was not sorry",OW

24110,"at their departure, and had flung himself back with a deep sigh of relief on the",OW

24111,"soft cushions of his embroidered couch, lying there, wild-eyed and openmouthed, like a brown woodland Faun, or some young animal of the forest",OW

24112,newly snared by the hunters.,OW

24113,"And, indeed, it was the hunters who had found him, coming upon him almost",OW

24114,"by chance as, bare-limbed and pipe in hand, he was following the flock of the",OW

24115,"poor goatherd who had brought him up, and whose son he had always fancied",OW

24116,himself to be. The child of the old King�s only daughter by a secret marriage,OW

24117,"with one much beneath her in station - a stranger, some said, who, by the",OW

24118,"wonderful magic of his lute-playing, had made the young Princess love him;",OW

24119,"while others spoke of an artist from Rimini, to whom the Princess had shown",OW

24120,"much, perhaps too much honour, and who had suddenly disappeared from the",OW

24121,"city, leaving his work in the Cathedral unfinished - he had been, when but a",OW

24122,"week old, stolen away from his mother�s side, as she slept, and given into the",OW

24123,"charge of a common peasant and his wife, who were without children of their",OW

24124,"own, and lived in a remote part of the forest, more than a day�s ride from the",OW

24125,"town. Grief, or the plague, as the court physician stated, or, as some",OW

24126,"suggested, a swift Italian poison administered in a cup of spiced wine, slew,",OW

24127,"within an hour of her wakening, the white girl who had given him birth, and as",OW

24128,the trusty messenger who bare the child across his saddle-bow stooped from,OW

24129,"his weary horse and knocked at the rude door of the goatherd�s hut, the body",OW

24130,of the Princess was being lowered into an open grave that had been dug in a,OW

24131,"deserted churchyard, beyond the city gates, a grave where it was said that",OW

24132,"another body was also lying, that of a young man of marvellous and foreign",OW

24133,"beauty, whose hands were tied behind him with a knotted cord, and whose",OW

24134,breast was stabbed with many red wounds.,OW

24135,"Such, at least, was the story that men whispered to each other. Certain it was",OW

24136,"that the old King, when on his deathbed, whether moved by remorse for his",OW

24137,"great sin, or merely desiring that the kingdom should not pass away from his",OW

24138,"line, had had the lad sent for, and, in the presence of the Council, had",OW

24139,acknowledged him as his heir.,OW

24140,And it seems that from the very first moment of his recognition he had shown,OW

24141,signs of that strange passion for beauty that was destined to have so great an,OW

24142,influence over his life. Those who accompanied him to the suite of rooms set,OW

24143,"apart for his service, often spoke of the cry of pleasure that broke from his lips",OW

24144,when he saw the delicate raiment and rich jewels that had been prepared for,OW

24145,"him, and of the almost fierce joy with which he flung aside his rough leathern",OW

24146,"tunic and coarse sheepskin cloak. He missed, indeed, at times the fine",OW

24147,"freedom of his forest life, and was always apt to chafe at the tedious Court",OW

24148,"ceremonies that occupied so much of each day, but the wonderful palace",OW

24149,"- Joyeuse, as they called it - of which he now found himself lord, seemed to",OW

24150,him to be a new world fresh-fashioned for his delight; and as soon as he could,OW

24151,"escape from the council-board or audience-chamber, he would run down the",OW

24152,"great staircase, with its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry,",OW

24153,"and wander from room to room, and from corridor to corridor, like one who",OW

24154,"was seeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain, a sort of restoration from",OW

24155,sickness.,OW

24156,"Upon these journeys of discovery, as he would call them - and, indeed, they",OW

24157,"were to him real voyages through a marvellous land, he would sometimes be",OW

24158,"accompanied by the slim, fair-haired Court pages, with their floating mantles,",OW

24159,"and gay fluttering ribands; but more often he would be alone, feeling through a",OW

24160,"certain quick instinct, which was almost a divination, that the secrets of art are",OW

24161,"best learned in secret, and that Beauty, like Wisdom, loves the lonely",OW

24162,worshipper.,OW

24163,Many curious stories were related about him at this period. It was said that a,OW

24164,"stout Burgo-master, who had come to deliver a florid oratorical address on",OW

24165,"behalf of the citizens of the town, had caught sight of him kneeling in real",OW

24166,"adoration before a great picture that had just been brought from Venice, and",OW

24167,that seemed to herald the worship of some new gods. On another occasion he,OW

24168,"had been missed for several hours, and after a lengthened search had been",OW

24169,discovered in a little chamber in one of the northern turrets of the palace,OW

24170,"gazing, as one in a trance, at a Greek gem carved with the figure of Adonis.",OW

24171,"He had been seen, so the tale ran, pressing his warm lips to the marble brow of",OW

24172,an antique statue that had been discovered in the bed of the river on the,OW

24173,"occasion of the building of the stone bridge, and was inscribed with the name",OW

24174,of the Bithynian slave of Hadrian. He had passed a whole night in noting the,OW

24175,effect of the moonlight on a silver image of Endymion.,OW

24176,"All rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him, and in",OW

24177,"his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants, some to",OW

24178,"traffic for amber with the rough fisher-folk of the north seas, some to Egypt to",OW

24179,look for that curious green turquoise which is found only in the tombs of,OW

24180,"kings, and is said to possess magical properties, some to Persia for silken",OW

24181,"carpets and painted pottery, and others to India to buy gauze and stained ivory,",OW

24182,"moonstones and bracelets of jade, sandal-wood and blue enamel and shawls of",OW

24183,fine wool.,OW

24184,But what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his,OW

24185,"coronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby-studded crown, and the",OW

24186,"sceptre with its rows and rings of pearls. Indeed, it was of this that he was",OW

24187,"thinking to-night, as he lay back on his luxurious couch, watching the great",OW

24188,"pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth. The designs,",OW

24189,"which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the time, had been",OW

24190,"submitted to him many months before, and he had given orders that the",OW

24191,"artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out, and that the whole world",OW

24192,was to be searched for jewels that would be worthy of their work. He saw,OW

24193,himself in fancy standing at the high altar of the cathedral in the fair raiment,OW

24194,"of a King, and a smile played and lingered about his boyish lips, and lit up",OW

24195,with a bright lustre his dark woodland eyes.,OW

24196,"After some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved",OW

24197,"penthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly-lit room. The walls were",OW

24198,"hung with rich tapestries representing the Triumph of Beauty. A large press,",OW

24199,"inlaid with agate and lapis-lazuli, filled one corner, and facing the window",OW

24200,stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and,OW

24201,"mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets of Venetian glass,",OW

24202,and a cup of dark-veined onyx. Pale poppies were broidered on the silk,OW

24203,"coverlet of the bed, as though they had fallen from the tired hands of sleep,",OW

24204,"and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the velvet canopy, from which great tufts",OW

24205,"of ostrich plumes sprang, like white foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted",OW

24206,ceiling. A laughing Narcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its,OW

24207,head. On the table stood a flat bowl of amethyst.,OW

24208,"Outside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming like a bubble",OW

24209,"over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels pacing up and down on the",OW

24210,"misty terrace by the river. Far away, in an orchard, a nightingale was singing.",OW

24211,A faint perfume of jasmine came through the open window. He brushed his,OW

24212,"brown curls back from his forehead, and taking up a lute, let his fingers stray",OW

24213,"across the cords. His heavy eyelids drooped, and a strange languor came over",OW

24214,"him. Never before had he felt so keenly, or with such exquisite joy, the magic",OW

24215,and the mystery of beautiful things.,OW

24216,"When midnight sounded from the clock-tower he touched a bell, and his pages",OW

24217,"entered and disrobed him with much ceremony, pouring rose-water over his",OW

24218,"hands, and strewing flowers on his pillow. A few moments after that they had",OW

24219,"left the room, he fell asleep.",OW

24220,"And as he slept he dreamed a dream, and this was his dream.",OW

24221,"He thought that he was standing in a long, low attic, amidst the whir and",OW

24222,clatter of many looms. The meagre daylight peered in through the grated,OW

24223,"windows, and showed him the gaunt figures of the weavers bending over their",OW

24224,"cases. Pale, sickly-looking children were crouched on the huge crossbeams.",OW

24225,"As the shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the heavy battens, and",OW

24226,when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall and pressed the threads,OW

24227,"together. Their faces were pinched with famine, and their thin hands shook",OW

24228,and trembled. Some haggard women were seated at a table sewing. A,OW

24229,"horrible odour filled the place. The air was foul and heavy, and the walls",OW

24230,dripped and streamed with damp.,OW

24231,"The young King went over to one of the weavers, and stood by him and",OW

24232,watched him.,OW

24233,"And the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, �Why art thou watching me?",OW

24234,Art thou a spy set on us by our master?�,OW

24235,�Who is thy master?� asked the young King.,OW

24236,"�Our master!� cried the weaver, bitterly. �He is a man like myself. Indeed,",OW

24237,there is but this difference between us - that he wears fine clothes while I go in,OW

24238,"rags, and that while I am weak from hunger he suffers not a little from",OW

24239,overfeeding.�,OW

24240,"�The land is free,� said the young King, �and thou art no man�s slave.�",OW

24241,"�In war,� answered the weaver, �the strong make slaves of the weak, and in",OW

24242,"peace the rich make slaves of the poor. We must work to live, and they give us",OW

24243,"such mean wages that we die. We toil for them all day long, and they heap up",OW

24244,"gold in their coffers, and our children fade away before their time, and the",OW

24245,"faces of those we love become hard and evil. We tread out the grapes, and",OW

24246,"another drinks the wine. We sow the corn, and our own board is empty. We",OW

24247,"have chains, though no eye beholds them; and are slaves, though men call us",OW

24248,free.�,OW

24249,"�Is it so with all?� he asked,",OW

24250,"�It is so with all,� answered the weaver, �with the young as well as with the",OW

24251,"old, with the women as well as with the men, with the little children as well as",OW

24252,"with those who are stricken in years. The merchants grind us down, and we",OW

24253,"must needs do their bidding. The priest rides by and tells his beads, and no",OW

24254,man has care of us. Through our sunless lanes creeps Poverty with her hungry,OW

24255,"eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows close behind her. Misery wakes us",OW

24256,"in the morning, and Shame sits with us at night. But what are these things to",OW

24257,thee? Thou art not one of us. Thy face is too happy.� And he turned away,OW

24258,"scowling, and threw the shuttle across the loom, and the young King saw that",OW

24259,it was threaded with a thread of gold.,OW

24260,"And a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, �What robe is",OW

24261,this that thou art weaving?�,OW

24262,"�It is the robe for the coronation of the young King,� he answered; �what is that",OW

24263,to thee?�,OW

24264,"And the young King gave a loud cry and woke, and lo! he was in his own",OW

24265,"chamber, and through the window he saw the great honey-coloured moon",OW

24266,hanging in the dusky air.,OW

24267,"And he fell asleep again and dreamed, and this was his dream.",OW

24268,He thought that he was lying on the deck of a huge galley that was being,OW

24269,rowed by a hundred slaves. On a carpet by his side the master of the galley,OW

24270,"was seated. He was black as ebony, and his turban was of crimson silk. Great",OW

24271,"earrings of silver dragged down the thick lobes of his ears, and in his hands he",OW

24272,had a pair of ivory scales.,OW

24273,"The slaves were naked, but for a ragged loin-cloth, and each man was chained",OW

24274,"to his neighbour. The hot sun beat brightly upon them, and the negroes ran up",OW

24275,and down the gangway and lashed them with whips of hide. They stretched,OW

24276,out their lean arms and pulled the heavy oars through the water. The salt spray,OW

24277,flew from the blades.,OW

24278,"At last they reached a little bay, and began to take soundings. A light wind",OW

24279,"blew from the shore, and covered the deck and the great lateen sail with a fine",OW

24280,red dust. Three Arabs mounted on wild asses rode out and threw spears at,OW

24281,them. The master of the galley took a painted bow in his hand and shot one of,OW

24282,"them in the throat. He fell heavily into the surf, and his companions galloped",OW

24283,"away. A woman wrapped in a yellow veil followed slowly on a camel,",OW

24284,looking back now and then at the dead body.,OW

24285,"As soon as they had cast anchor and hauled down the sail, the negroes went",OW

24286,"into the hold and brought up a long rope-ladder, heavily weighted with lead.",OW

24287,"The master of the galley threw it over the side, making the ends fast to two",OW

24288,iron stanchions. Then the negroes seized the youngest of the slaves and,OW

24289,"knocked his gyves off, and filled his nostrils and his ears with wax, and tied a",OW

24290,"big stone round his waist. He crept wearily down the ladder, and disappeared",OW

24291,into the sea. A few bubbles rose where he sank. Some of the other slaves,OW

24292,"peered curiously over the side. At the prow of the galley sat a shark-charmer,",OW

24293,beating monotonously upon a drum.,OW

24294,"After some time the diver rose up out of the water, and clung panting to the",OW

24295,"ladder with a pearl in his right hand. The negroes seized it from him, and",OW

24296,thrust him back. The slaves fell asleep over their oars.,OW

24297,"Again and again he came up, and each time that he did so he brought with him",OW

24298,"a beautiful pearl. The master of the galley weighed them, and put them into a",OW

24299,little bag of green leather.,OW

24300,"The young King tried to speak, but his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of",OW

24301,"his mouth, and his lips refused to move. The Negroes chattered to each other,",OW

24302,and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads. Two cranes flew round and,OW

24303,round the vessel.,OW

24304,"Then the diver came up for the last time, and the pearl that he brought with",OW

24305,"him was fairer than all the pearls of Ormuz, for it was shaped like the full",OW

24306,"moon, and whiter than the morning star. But his face was strangely pale, and",OW

24307,as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils. He,OW

24308,"quivered for a little, and then he was still. The negroes shrugged their",OW

24309,"shoulders, and threw the body overboard.",OW

24310,"And the master of the galley laughed, and, reaching out, he took the pearl, and",OW

24311,"when he saw it he pressed it to his forehead and bowed. �It shall be,� he said,",OW

24312,"�for the sceptre of the young King,� and he made a sign to the negroes to draw",OW

24313,up the anchor.,OW

24314,"And when the young King heard this he gave a great cry, and woke, and",OW

24315,through the window he saw the long grey fingers of the dawn clutching at the,OW

24316,fading stars.,OW

24317,"And he fell asleep again, and dreamed, and this was his dream.",OW

24318,"He thought that he was wandering through a dim wood, hung with strange",OW

24319,fruits and with beautiful poisonous flowers. The adders hissed at him as he,OW

24320,"went by, and the bright parrots flew screaming from branch to branch. Huge",OW

24321,tortoises lay asleep upon the hot mud. The trees were full of apes and,OW

24322,peacocks.,OW

24323,"On and on he went, till he reached the outskirts of the wood, and there he saw",OW

24324,an immense multitude of men toiling in the bed of a dried-up river. They,OW

24325,swarmed up the crag like ants. They dug deep pits in the ground and went,OW

24326,down into them. Some of them cleft the rocks with great axes; others grabbled,OW

24327,in the sand.,OW

24328,"They tore up the cactus by its roots, and trampled on the scarlet blossoms.",OW

24329,"They hurried about, calling to each other, and no man was idle.",OW

24330,"From the darkness of a cavern Death and Avarice watched them, and Death",OW

24331,"said, �I am weary; give me a third of them and let me go.� But Avarice shook",OW

24332,"her head. �They are my servants,� she answered.",OW

24333,"And Death said to her, �What hast thou in thy hand?�",OW

24334,"�I have three grains of corn,� she answered; �what is that to thee?�",OW

24335,"�Give me one of them,� cried Death, �to plant in my garden; only one of them,",OW

24336,and I will go away.�,OW

24337,"�I will not give thee anything,� said Avarice, and she hid her hand in the fold of",OW

24338,her raiment.,OW

24339,"And Death laughed, and took a cup, and dipped it into a pool of water, and out",OW

24340,"of the cup rose Ague. She passed through the great multitude, and a third of",OW

24341,"them lay dead. A cold mist followed her, and the water-snakes ran by her side.",OW

24342,And when Avarice saw that a third of the multitude was dead she beat her,OW

24343,"breast and wept. She beat her barren bosom, and cried aloud. �Thou hast slain",OW

24344,"a third of my servants,� she cried, �get thee gone. There is war in the",OW

24345,"mountains of Tartary, and the kings of each side are calling to thee. The",OW

24346,"Afghans have slain the black ox, and are marching to battle. They have beaten",OW

24347,"upon their shields with their spears, and have put on their helmets of iron.",OW

24348,"What is my valley to thee, that thou shouldst tarry in it? Get thee gone, and",OW

24349,come here no more.�,OW

24350,"�Nay,� answered Death, �but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I will not",OW

24351,go.�,OW

24352,"But Avarice shut her hand, and clenched her teeth. �I will not give thee",OW

24353,"anything,� she muttered.",OW

24354,"And Death laughed, and took up a black stone, and threw it into the forest, and",OW

24355,out of a thicket of wild hemlock came Fever in a robe of flame. She passed,OW

24356,"through the multitude, and touched them, and each man that she touched died.",OW

24357,The grass withered beneath her feet as she walked.,OW

24358,"And Avarice shuddered, and put ashes on her head. �Thou art cruel,� she cried;",OW

24359,"�thou art cruel. There is famine in the walled cities of India, and the cisterns",OW

24360,"of Samarcand have run dry. There is famine in the walled cities of Egypt, and",OW

24361,the locusts have come up from the desert. The Nile has not overflowed its,OW

24362,"banks, and the priests have cursed Isis and Osiris. Get thee gone to those who",OW

24363,"need thee, and leave me my servants.�",OW

24364,"�Nay,� answered Death, �but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I will not",OW

24365,go.�,OW

24366,"�I will not give thee anything,� said Avarice.",OW

24367,"And Death laughed again, and he whistled through his fingers, and a woman",OW

24368,"came flying through the air. Plague was written upon her forehead, and a",OW

24369,crowd of lean vultures wheeled round her. She covered the valley with her,OW

24370,"wings, and no man was left alive.",OW

24371,"And Avarice fled shrieking through the forest, and Death leaped upon his red",OW

24372,"horse and galloped away, and his galloping was faster than the wind.",OW

24373,And out of the slime at the bottom of the valley crept dragons and horrible,OW

24374,"things with scales, and the jackals came trotting along the sand, sniffing up the",OW

24375,air with their nostrils.,OW

24376,"And the young King wept, and said: �Who were these men, and for what were",OW

24377,they seeking?�,OW

24378,"�For rubies for a king�s crown,� answered one who stood behind him.",OW

24379,"And the young King started, and, turning round, he saw a man habited as a",OW

24380,pilgrim and holding in his hand a mirror of silver.,OW

24381,"And he grew pale, and said: �For what king?�",OW

24382,"And the pilgrim answered: �Look in this mirror, and thou shalt see him.�",OW

24383,"And he looked in the mirror, and, seeing his own face, he gave a great cry and",OW

24384,"woke, and the bright sunlight was streaming into the room, and from the trees",OW

24385,of the garden and pleasaunce the birds were singing.,OW

24386,And the Chamberlain and the high officers of State came in and made,OW

24387,"obeisance to him, and the pages brought him the robe of tissued gold, and set",OW

24388,the crown and the sceptre before him.,OW

24389,"And the young King looked at them, and they were beautiful. More beautiful",OW

24390,"were they than aught that he had ever seen. But he remembered his dreams,",OW

24391,"and he said to his lords: �Take these things away, for I will not wear them.�",OW

24392,"And the courtiers were amazed, and some of them laughed, for they thought",OW

24393,that he was jesting.,OW

24394,"But he spake sternly to them again, and said: �Take these things away, and",OW

24395,"hide them from me. Though it be the day of my coronation, I will not wear",OW

24396,"them. For on the loom of Sorrow, and by the white hands of Pain, has this my",OW

24397,"robe been woven. There is Blood in the heart of the ruby, and Death in the",OW

24398,heart of the pearl.� And he told them his three dreams.,OW

24399,"And when the courtiers heard them they looked at each other and whispered,",OW

24400,"saying: �Surely he is mad; for what is a dream but a dream, and a vision but a",OW

24401,vision? They are not real things that one should heed them. And what have,OW

24402,we to do with the lives of those who toil for us? Shall a man not eat bread till,OW

24403,"he has seen the sower, nor drink wine till he has talked with the vinedresser?�",OW

24404,"And the Chamberlain spake to the young King, and said, �My lord, I pray thee",OW

24405,"set aside these black thoughts of thine, and put on this fair robe, and set this",OW

24406,"crown upon thy head. For how shall the people know that thou art a king, if",OW

24407,thou hast not a king�s raiment?�,OW

24408,"And the young King looked at him. �Is it so, indeed?� he questioned. �Will",OW

24409,they not know me for a king if I have not a king�s raiment?�,OW

24410,"�They will not know thee, my lord,� cried the Chamberlain.",OW

24411,"�I had thought that there had been men who were kinglike,� he answered, �but",OW

24412,"it may be as thou sayest. And yet I will not wear this robe, nor will I be",OW

24413,"crowned with this crown, but even as I came to the palace so will I go forth",OW

24414,from it.�,OW

24415,"And he bade them all leave him, save one page whom he kept as his",OW

24416,"companion, a lad a year younger than himself. Him he kept for his service,",OW

24417,"and when he had bathed himself in clear water, he opened a great painted",OW

24418,"chest, and from it he took the leathern tunic and rough sheepskin cloak that he",OW

24419,had worn when he had watched on the hillside the shaggy goats of the,OW

24420,"goatherd. These he put on, and in his hand he took his rude shepherd�s staff.",OW

24421,"And the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said smiling to",OW

24422,"him, �My lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where is thy crown?�",OW

24423,And the young King plucked a spray of wild briar that was climbing over the,OW

24424,"balcony, and bent it, and made a circlet of it, and set it on his own head.",OW

24425,"�This shall he my crown,� he answered.",OW

24426,"And thus attired he passed out of his chamber into the Great Hall, where the",OW

24427,nobles were waiting for him.,OW

24428,"And the nobles made merry, and some of them cried out to him, �My lord, the",OW

24429,"people wait for their king, and thou showest them a beggar,� and others were",OW

24430,"wroth and said, �He brings shame upon our state, and is unworthy to be our",OW

24431,"master.� But he answered them not a word, but passed on, and went down the",OW

24432,"bright porphyry staircase, and out through the gates of bronze, and mounted",OW

24433,"upon his horse, and rode towards the cathedral, the little page running beside",OW

24434,him.,OW

24435,"And the people laughed and said, �It is the King�s fool who is riding by,� and",OW

24436,they mocked him.,OW

24437,"And he drew rein and said, �Nay, but I am the King.� And he told them his",OW

24438,three dreams.,OW

24439,"And a man came out of the crowd and spake bitterly to him, and said, �Sir,",OW

24440,knowest thou not that out of the luxury of the rich cometh the life of the poor?,OW

24441,"By your pomp we are nurtured, and your vices give us bread. To toil for a",OW

24442,"hard master is bitter, but to have no master to toil for is more bitter still.",OW

24443,Thinkest thou that the ravens will feed us? And what cure hast thou for these,OW

24444,"things? Wilt thou say to the buyer, �Thou shalt buy for so much,� and to the",OW

24445,"seller, �Thou shalt sell at this price�? I trow not. Therefore go back to thy",OW

24446,"Palace and put on thy purple and fine linen. What hast thou to do with us, and",OW

24447,what we suffer?�,OW

24448,�Are not the rich and the poor brothers?� asked the young King.,OW

24449,"�Ay,� answered the man, �and the name of the rich brother is Cain.�",OW

24450,"And the young King�s eyes filled with tears, and he rode on through the",OW

24451,"murmurs of the people, and the little page grew afraid and left him.",OW

24452,"And when he reached the great portal of the cathedral, the soldiers thrust their",OW

24453,"halberts out and said, �What dost thou seek here? None enters by this door but",OW

24454,the King.�,OW

24455,"And his face flushed with anger, and he said to them, �I am the King,� and",OW

24456,waved their halberts aside and passed in.,OW

24457,"And when the old Bishop saw him coming in his goatherd�s dress, he rose up",OW

24458,"in wonder from his throne, and went to meet him, and said to him, �My son, is",OW

24459,"this a king�s apparel? And with what crown shall I crown thee, and what",OW

24460,"sceptre shall I place in thy hand? Surely this should be to thee a day of joy,",OW

24461,and not a day of abasement.�,OW

24462,�Shall Joy wear what Grief has fashioned?� said the young King. And he told,OW

24463,him his three dreams.,OW

24464,"And when the Bishop had heard them he knit his brows, and said, �My son, I",OW

24465,"am an old man, and in the winter of my days, and I know that many evil things",OW

24466,are done in the wide world. The fierce robbers come down from the,OW

24467,"mountains, and carry off the little children, and sell them to the Moors. The",OW

24468,"lions lie in wait for the caravans, and leap upon the camels. The wild boar",OW

24469,"roots up the corn in the valley, and the foxes gnaw the vines upon the hill. The",OW

24470,"pirates lay waste the sea-coast and burn the ships of the fishermen, and take",OW

24471,their nets from them. In the salt-marshes live the lepers; they have houses of,OW

24472,"wattled reeds, and none may come nigh them. The beggars wander through",OW

24473,"the cities, and eat their food with the dogs. Canst thou make these things not",OW

24474,"to be? Wilt thou take the leper for thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy",OW

24475,"board? Shall the lion do thy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee? Is not He",OW

24476,who made misery wiser than thou art? Wherefore I praise thee not for this that,OW

24477,"thou hast done, but I bid thee ride back to the Palace and make thy face glad,",OW

24478,"and put on the raiment that beseemeth a king, and with the crown of gold I",OW

24479,"will crown thee, and the sceptre of pearl will I place in thy hand. And as for",OW

24480,"thy dreams, think no more of them. The burden of this world is too great for",OW

24481,"one man to bear, and the world�s sorrow too heavy for one heart to suffer.�",OW

24482,"�Sayest thou that in this house?� said the young King, and he strode past the",OW

24483,"Bishop, and climbed up the steps of the altar, and stood before the image of",OW

24484,Christ.,OW

24485,"He stood before the image of Christ, and on his right hand and on his left were",OW

24486,"the marvellous vessels of gold, the chalice with the yellow wine, and the vial",OW

24487,"with the holy oil. He knelt before the image of Christ, and the great candles",OW

24488,"burned brightly by the jewelled shrine, and the smoke of the incense curled in",OW

24489,"thin blue wreaths through the dome. He bowed his head in prayer, and the",OW

24490,priests in their stiff copes crept away from the altar.,OW

24491,"And suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside, and in entered the",OW

24492,"nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes, and shields of polished steel.",OW

24493,�Where is this dreamer of dreams?� they cried. �Where is this King who is,OW

24494,apparelled like a beggar - this boy who brings shame upon our state? Surely,OW

24495,"we will slay him, for he is unworthy to rule over us.�",OW

24496,"And the young King bowed his head again, and prayed, and when he had",OW

24497,"finished his prayer he rose up, and turning round he looked at them sadly.",OW

24498,"And lo! through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming upon him,",OW

24499,and the sun-beams wove round him a tissued robe that was fairer than the robe,OW

24500,"that had been fashioned for his pleasure. The dead staff blossomed, and bare",OW

24501,"lilies that were whiter than pearls. The dry thorn blossomed, and bare roses",OW

24502,"that were redder than rubies. Whiter than fine pearls were the lilies, and their",OW

24503,"stems were of bright silver. Redder than male rubies were the roses, and their",OW

24504,leaves were of beaten gold.,OW

24505,"He stood there in the raiment of a king, and the gates of the jewelled shrine",OW

24506,"flew open, and from the crystal of the many-rayed monstrance shone a",OW

24507,"marvellous and mystical light. He stood there in a king�s raiment, and the",OW

24508,"Glory of God filled the place, and the saints in their carven niches seemed to",OW

24509,"move. In the fair raiment of a king he stood before them, and the organ pealed",OW

24510,"out its music, and the trumpeters blew upon their trumpets, and the singing",OW

24511,boys sang.,OW

24512,"And the people fell upon their knees in awe, and the nobles sheathed their",OW

24513,"swords and did homage, and the Bishop�s face grew pale, and his hands",OW

24514,"trembled. �A greater than I hath crowned thee,� he cried, and he knelt before",OW

24515,him.,OW

24516,"And the young King came down from the high altar, and passed home through",OW

24517,"the midst of the people. But no man dared look upon his face, for it was like",OW

24518,the face of an angel.,OW

24519,THE BIRTHDAY OF THE INFANTA,OW

24520,[TO MRS. WILLIAM H. GRENFELL OF TAPLOW COURT - LADY,OW

24521,DESBOROUGH],OW

24522,"It was the birthday of the Infanta. She was just twelve years of age, and the",OW

24523,sun was shining brightly in the gardens of the palace.,OW

24524,"Although she was a real Princess and the Infanta of Spain, she had only one",OW

24525,"birthday every year, just like the children of quite poor people, so it was",OW

24526,naturally a matter of great importance to the whole country that she should,OW

24527,have a really fine day for the occasion. And a really fine day it certainly was.,OW

24528,"The tall striped tulips stood straight up upon their stalks, like long rows of",OW

24529,"soldiers, and looked defiantly across the grass at the roses, and said: �We are",OW

24530,quite as splendid as you are now.� The purple butterflies fluttered about with,OW

24531,"gold dust on their wings, visiting each flower in turn; the little lizards crept out",OW

24532,"of the crevices of the wall, and lay basking in the white glare; and the",OW

24533,"pomegranates split and cracked with the heat, and showed their bleeding red",OW

24534,hearts. Even the pale yellow lemons that hung in such profusion from the,OW

24535,mouldering trellis and along the dim arcades seemed to have caught a richer,OW

24536,"colour from the wonderful sunlight, and the magnolia trees opened their great",OW

24537,"globe-like blossoms of folded ivory, and filled the air with a sweet heavy",OW

24538,perfume.,OW

24539,The little Princess herself walked up and down the terrace with her,OW

24540,"companions, and played at hide and seek round the stone vases and the old",OW

24541,moss-grown statues. On ordinary days she was only allowed to play with,OW

24542,"children of her own rank, so she had always to play alone, but her birthday",OW

24543,"was an exception, and the King had given orders that she was to invite any of",OW

24544,her young friends whom she liked to come and amuse themselves with her.,OW

24545,There was a stately grace about these slim Spanish children as they glided,OW

24546,"about, the boys with their large-plumed hats and short fluttering cloaks, the",OW

24547,"girls holding up the trains of their long brocaded gowns, and shielding the sun",OW

24548,from their eyes with huge fans of black and silver. But the Infanta was the,OW

24549,"most graceful of all, and the most tastefully attired, after the somewhat",OW

24550,"cumbrous fashion of the day. Her robe was of grey satin, the skirt and the",OW

24551,"wide puffed sleeves heavily embroidered with silver, and the stiff corset",OW

24552,studded with rows of fine pearls. Two tiny slippers with big pink rosettes,OW

24553,peeped out beneath her dress as she walked. Pink and pearl was her great,OW

24554,"gauze fan, and in her hair, which like an aureole of faded gold stood out stiffly",OW

24555,"round her pale little face, she had a beautiful white rose.",OW

24556,From a window in the palace the sad melancholy King watched them. Behind,OW

24557,"him stood his brother, Don Pedro of Aragon, whom he hated, and his",OW

24558,"confessor, the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, sat by his side. Sadder even than",OW

24559,"usual was the King, for as he looked at the Infanta bowing with childish",OW

24560,"gravity to the assembling counters, or laughing behind her fan at the grim",OW

24561,"Duchess of Albuquerque who always accompanied her, he thought of the",OW

24562,"young Queen, her mother, who but a short time before - so it seemed to him had come from the gay country of France, and had withered away in the",OW

24563,"sombre splendour of the Spanish court, dying just six months after the birth of",OW

24564,"her child, and before she had seen the almonds blossom twice in the orchard,",OW

24565,or plucked the second year�s fruit from the old gnarled fig-tree that stood in,OW

24566,the centre of the now grass-grown courtyard. So great had been his love for,OW

24567,her that he had not suffered even the grave to hide her from him. She had,OW

24568,"been embalmed by a Moorish physician, who in return for this service had",OW

24569,"been granted his life, which for heresy and suspicion of magical practices had",OW

24570,"been already forfeited, men said, to the Holy Office, and her body was still",OW

24571,"lying on its tapestried bier in the black marble chapel of the Palace, just as the",OW

24572,monks had borne her in on that windy March day nearly twelve years before.,OW

24573,"Once every month the King, wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled",OW

24574,"lantern in his hand, went in and knelt by her side calling out, �Mi reina! Mi",OW

24575,reina!� and sometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in Spain,OW

24576,"governs every separate action of life, and sets limits even to the sorrow of a",OW

24577,"King, he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of grief, and",OW

24578,try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face.,OW

24579,"To-day he seemed to see her again, as he had seen her first at the Castle of",OW

24580,"Fontainebleau, when he was but fifteen years of age, and she still younger.",OW

24581,They had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the Papal Nuncio in the,OW

24582,"presence of the French King and all the Court, and he had returned to the",OW

24583,"Escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow hair, and the memory of",OW

24584,two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand as he stepped into his,OW

24585,"carriage. Later on had followed the marriage, hastily performed at Burgos, a",OW

24586,"small town on the frontier between the two countries, and the grand public",OW

24587,entry into Madrid with the customary celebration of high mass at the Church,OW

24588,"of La Atocha, and a more than usually solemnauto-da-f�, in which nearly three",OW

24589,"hundred heretics, amongst whom were many Englishmen, had been delivered",OW

24590,over to the secular arm to be burned.,OW

24591,"Certainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many thought, of his",OW

24592,"country, then at war with England for the possession of the empire of the New",OW

24593,"World. He had hardly ever permitted her to be out of his sight; for her, he had",OW

24594,"forgotten, or seemed to have forgotten, all grave affairs of State; and, with that",OW

24595,"terrible blindness that passion brings upon its servants, he had failed to notice",OW

24596,that the elaborate ceremonies by which he sought to please her did but,OW

24597,aggravate the strange malady from which she suffered. When she died he,OW

24598,"was, for a time, like one bereft of reason. Indeed, there is no doubt but that he",OW

24599,would have formally abdicated and retired to the great Trappist monastery at,OW

24600,"Granada, of which he was already titular Prior, had he not been afraid to leave",OW

24601,"the little Infanta at the mercy of his brother, whose cruelty, even in Spain, was",OW

24602,"notorious, and who was suspected by many of having caused the Queen�s",OW

24603,death by means of a pair of poisoned gloves that he had presented to her on the,OW

24604,occasion of her visiting his castle in Aragon. Even after the expiration of the,OW

24605,three years of public mourning that he had ordained throughout his whole,OW

24606,"dominions by royal edict, he would never suffer his ministers to speak about",OW

24607,"any new alliance, and when the Emperor himself sent to him, and offered him",OW

24608,"the hand of the lovely Archduchess of Bohemia, his niece, in marriage, he",OW

24609,bade the ambassadors tell their master that the King of Spain was already,OW

24610,"wedded to Sorrow, and that though she was but a barren bride he loved her",OW

24611,better than Beauty; an answer that cost his crown the rich provinces of the,OW

24612,"Netherlands, which soon after, at the Emperor�s instigation, revolted against",OW

24613,him under the leadership of some fanatics of the Reformed Church.,OW

24614,"His whole married life, with its fierce, fiery-coloured joys and the terrible",OW

24615,"agony of its sudden ending, seemed to come back to him to-day as he watched",OW

24616,the Infanta playing on the terrace. She had all the Queen�s pretty petulance of,OW

24617,"manner, the same wilful way of tossing her head, the same proud curved",OW

24618,"beautiful mouth, the same wonderful smile - vrai sourire de France indeed as she glanced up now and then at the window, or stretched out her little hand",OW

24619,for the stately Spanish gentlemen to kiss. But the shrill laughter of the,OW

24620,"children grated on his ears, and the bright pitiless sunlight mocked his sorrow,",OW

24621,"and a dull odour of strange spices, spices such as embalmers use, seemed to",OW

24622,"taint - or was it fancy? - the clear morning air. He buried his face in his hands,",OW

24623,"and when the Infanta looked up again the curtains had been drawn, and the",OW

24624,King had retired.,OW

24625,"She made a little moue of disappointment, and shrugged her shoulders. Surely",OW

24626,"he might have stayed with her on her birthday. What did the stupid Stateaffairs matter? Or had he gone to that gloomy chapel, where the candles were",OW

24627,"always burning, and where she was never allowed to enter? How silly of him,",OW

24628,"when the sun was shining so brightly, and everybody was so happy! Besides,",OW

24629,he would miss the sham bull-fight for which the trumpet was already,OW

24630,"sounding, to say nothing of the puppet-show and the other wonderful things.",OW

24631,Her uncle and the Grand Inquisitor were much more sensible. They had come,OW

24632,"out on the terrace, and paid her nice compliments. So she tossed her pretty",OW

24633,"head, and taking Don Pedro by the hand, she walked slowly down the steps",OW

24634,towards a long pavilion of purple silk that had been erected at the end of the,OW

24635,"garden, the other children following in strict order of precedence, those who",OW

24636,had the longest names going first.,OW

24637,"A procession of noble boys, fantastically dressed as toreadors, came out to",OW

24638,"meet her, and the young Count of Tierra-Nueva, a wonderfully handsome lad",OW

24639,"of about fourteen years of age, uncovering his head with all the grace of a born",OW

24640,"hidalgo and grandee of Spain, led her solemnly in to a little gilt and ivory chair",OW

24641,that was placed on a raised dais above the arena. The children grouped,OW

24642,"themselves all round, fluttering their big fans and whispering to each other,",OW

24643,and Don Pedro and the Grand Inquisitor stood laughing at the entrance. Even,OW

24644,"the Duchess - the Camerera-Mayor as she was called - a thin, hard-featured",OW

24645,"woman with a yellow ruff, did not look quite so bad-tempered as usual, and",OW

24646,something like a chill smile flitted across her wrinkled face and twitched her,OW

24647,thin bloodless lips.,OW

24648,"It certainly was a marvellous bull-fight, and much nicer, the Infanta thought,",OW

24649,"than the real bull-fight that she had been brought to see at Seville, on the",OW

24650,occasion of the visit of the Duke of Parma to her father. Some of the boys,OW

24651,pranced about on richly-caparisoned hobby-horses brandishing long javelins,OW

24652,with gay streamers of bright ribands attached to them; others went on foot,OW

24653,"waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull, and vaulting lightly over the barrier",OW

24654,"when he charged them; and as for the bull himself, he was just like a live bull,",OW

24655,"though he was only made of wicker-work and stretched hide, and sometimes",OW

24656,"insisted on running round the arena on his hind legs, which no live bull ever",OW

24657,"dreams of doing. He made a splendid fight of it too, and the children got so",OW

24658,"excited that they stood up upon the benches, and waved their lace",OW

24659,handkerchiefs and cried out: Bravo toro! Bravo toro! just as sensibly as if,OW

24660,"they had been grown-up people. At last, however, after a prolonged combat,",OW

24661,"during which several of the hobby-horses were gored through and through,",OW

24662,"and, their riders dismounted, the young Count of Tierra-Nueva brought the",OW

24663,"bull to his knees, and having obtained permission from the Infanta to give",OW

24664,"the coup de gr�ce, he plunged his wooden sword into the neck of the animal",OW

24665,"with such violence that the head came right off, and disclosed the laughing",OW

24666,"face of little Monsieur de Lorraine, the son of the French Ambassador at",OW

24667,Madrid.,OW

24668,"The arena was then cleared amidst much applause, and the dead hobbyhorses",OW

24669,"dragged solemnly away by two Moorish pages in yellow and black liveries,",OW

24670,"and after a short interlude, during which a French posture-master performed",OW

24671,"upon the tightrope, some Italian puppets appeared in the semi-classical tragedy",OW

24672,of Sophonisba on the stage of a small theatre that had been built up for the,OW

24673,"purpose. They acted so well, and their gestures were so extremely natural, that",OW

24674,at the close of the play the eyes of the Infanta were quite dim with tears.,OW

24675,"Indeed some of the children really cried, and had to be comforted with",OW

24676,"sweetmeats, and the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not",OW

24677,help saying to Don Pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made,OW

24678,"simply out of wood and coloured wax, and worked mechanically by wires,",OW

24679,should be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes.,OW

24680,"An African juggler followed, who brought in a large flat basket covered with a",OW

24681,"red cloth, and having placed it in the centre of the arena, he took from his",OW

24682,"turban a curious reed pipe, and blew through it. In a few moments the cloth",OW

24683,"began to move, and as the pipe grew shriller and shriller two green and gold",OW

24684,"snakes put out their strange wedge-shaped heads and rose slowly up, swaying",OW

24685,"to and fro with the music as a plant sways in the water. The children,",OW

24686,"however, were rather frightened at their spotted hoods and quick darting",OW

24687,"tongues, and were much more pleased when the juggler made a tiny orangetree grow out of the sand and bear pretty white blossoms and clusters of real",OW

24688,"fruit; and when he took the fan of the little daughter of the Marquess de LasTorres, and changed it into a blue bird that flew all round the pavilion and",OW

24689,"sang, their delight and amazement knew no bounds. The solemn minuet, too,",OW

24690,"performed by the dancing boys from the church of Nuestra Senora Del Pilar,",OW

24691,was charming. The Infanta had never before seen this wonderful ceremony,OW

24692,which takes place every year at Maytime in front of the high altar of the,OW

24693,"Virgin, and in her honour; and indeed none of the royal family of Spain had",OW

24694,"entered the great cathedral of Saragossa since a mad priest, supposed by many",OW

24695,"to have been in the pay of Elizabeth of England, had tried to administer a",OW

24696,poisoned wafer to the Prince of the Asturias. So she had known only by,OW

24697,"hearsay of �Our Lady�s Dance,� as it was called, and it certainly was a",OW

24698,"beautiful sight. The boys wore old-fashioned court dresses of white velvet,",OW

24699,and their curious three-cornered hats were fringed with silver and surmounted,OW

24700,"with huge plumes of ostrich feathers, the dazzling whiteness of their costumes,",OW

24701,"as they moved about in the sunlight, being still more accentuated by their",OW

24702,swarthy faces and long black hair. Everybody was fascinated by the grave,OW

24703,"dignity with which they moved through the intricate figures of the dance, and",OW

24704,"by the elaborate grace of their slow gestures, and stately bows, and when they",OW

24705,had finished their performance and doffed their great plumed hats to the,OW

24706,"Infanta, she acknowledged their reverence with much courtesy, and made a",OW

24707,vow that she would send a large wax candle to the shrine of Our Lady of Pilar,OW

24708,in return for the pleasure that she had given her.,OW

24709,"A troop of handsome Egyptians - as the gipsies were termed in those days then advanced into the arena, and sitting down cross-legs, in a circle, began to",OW

24710,"play softly upon their zithers, moving their bodies to the tune, and humming,",OW

24711,"almost below their breath, a low dreamy air. When they caught sight of Don",OW

24712,"Pedro they scowled at him, and some of them looked terrified, for only a few",OW

24713,"weeks before he had had two of their tribe hanged for sorcery in the marketplace at Seville, but the pretty Infanta charmed them as she leaned back",OW

24714,"peeping over her fan with her great blue eyes, and they felt sure that one so",OW

24715,lovely as she was could never be cruel to anybody. So they played on very,OW

24716,"gently and just touching the cords of the zithers with their long pointed nails,",OW

24717,"and their heads began to nod as though they were falling asleep. Suddenly,",OW

24718,with a cry so shrill that all the children were startled and Don Pedro�s hand,OW

24719,"clutched at the agate pommel of his dagger, they leapt to their feet and whirled",OW

24720,"madly round the enclosure beating their tambourines, and chaunting some",OW

24721,wild love-song in their strange guttural language. Then at another signal they,OW

24722,"all flung themselves again to the ground and lay there quite still, the dull",OW

24723,strumming of the zithers being the only sound that broke the silence. After,OW

24724,"that they had done this several times, they disappeared for a moment and came",OW

24725,"back leading a brown shaggy bear by a chain, and carrying on their shoulders",OW

24726,some little Barbary apes. The bear stood upon his head with the utmost,OW

24727,"gravity, and the wizened apes played all kinds of amusing tricks with two",OW

24728,"gipsy boys who seemed to be their masters, and fought with tiny swords, and",OW

24729,"fired off guns, and went through a regular soldier�s drill just like the King�s",OW

24730,own bodyguard. In fact the gipsies were a great success.,OW

24731,"But the funniest part of the whole morning�s entertainment, was undoubtedly",OW

24732,"the dancing of the little Dwarf. When he stumbled into the arena, waddling on",OW

24733,"his crooked legs and wagging his huge misshapen head from side to side, the",OW

24734,"children went off into a loud shout of delight, and the Infanta herself laughed",OW

24735,so much that the Camerera was obliged to remind her that although there were,OW

24736,"many precedents in Spain for a King�s daughter weeping before her equals,",OW

24737,there were none for a Princess of the blood royal making so merry before,OW

24738,"those who were her inferiors in birth. The Dwarf, however, was really quite",OW

24739,"irresistible, and even at the Spanish Court, always noted for its cultivated",OW

24740,"passion for the horrible, so fantastic a little monster had never been seen. It",OW

24741,"was his first appearance, too. He had been discovered only the day before,",OW

24742,"running wild through the forest, by two of the nobles who happened to have",OW

24743,"been hunting in a remote part of the great cork-wood that surrounded the town,",OW

24744,and had been carried off by them to the Palace as a surprise for the Infanta; his,OW

24745,"father, who was a poor charcoal-burner, being but too well pleased to get rid of",OW

24746,so ugly and useless a child. Perhaps the most amusing thing about him was,OW

24747,his complete unconsciousness of his own grotesque appearance. Indeed he,OW

24748,"seemed quite happy and full of the highest spirits. When the children laughed,",OW

24749,"he laughed as freely and as joyously as any of them, and at the close of each",OW

24750,"dance he made them each the funniest of bows, smiling and nodding at them",OW

24751,"just as if he was really one of themselves, and not a little misshapen thing that",OW

24752,"Nature, in some humourous mood, had fashioned for others to mock at. As for",OW

24753,"the Infanta, she absolutely fascinated him. He could not keep his eyes off her,",OW

24754,"and seemed to dance for her alone, and when at the close of the performance,",OW

24755,remembering how she had seen the great ladies of the Court throw bouquets to,OW

24756,"Caffarelli, the famous Italian treble, whom the Pope had sent from his own",OW

24757,chapel to Madrid that he might cure the King�s melancholy by the sweetness,OW

24758,"of his voice, she took out of her hair the beautiful white rose, and partly for a",OW

24759,"jest and partly to tease the Camerera, threw it to him across the arena with her",OW

24760,"sweetest smile, he took the whole matter quite seriously, and pressing the",OW

24761,"flower to his rough coarse lips he put his hand upon his heart, and sank on one",OW

24762,"knee before her, grinning from ear to ear, and with his little bright eyes",OW

24763,sparkling with pleasure.,OW

24764,This so upset the gravity of the Infanta that she kept on laughing long after the,OW

24765,"little Dwarf had ran out of the arena, and expressed a desire to her uncle that",OW

24766,"the dance should be immediately repeated. The Camerera, however, on the",OW

24767,"plea that the sun was too hot, decided that it would be better that her Highness",OW

24768,"should return without delay to the Palace, where a wonderful feast had been",OW

24769,"already prepared for her, including a real birthday cake with her own initials",OW

24770,worked all over it in painted sugar and a lovely silver flag waving from the,OW

24771,"top. The Infanta accordingly rose up with much dignity, and having given",OW

24772,"orders that the little dwarf was to dance again for her after the hour of siesta,",OW

24773,and conveyed her thanks to the young Count of Tierra-Nueva for his charming,OW

24774,"reception, she went back to her apartments, the children following in the same",OW

24775,order in which they had entered.,OW

24776,Now when the little Dwarf heard that he was to dance a second time before the,OW

24777,"Infanta, and by her own express command, he was so proud that he ran out",OW

24778,"into the garden, kissing the white rose in an absurd ecstasy of pleasure, and",OW

24779,making the most uncouth and clumsy gestures of delight.,OW

24780,The Flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude into their beautiful,OW

24781,"home, and when they saw him capering up and down the walks, and waving",OW

24782,"his arms above his head in such a ridiculous manner, they could not restrain",OW

24783,their feelings any longer.,OW

24784,"�He is really far too ugly to be allowed to play in any place where we are,�",OW

24785,cried the Tulips.,OW

24786,"�He should drink poppy-juice, and go to sleep for a thousand years,� said the",OW

24787,"great scarlet Lilies, and they grew quite hot and angry.",OW

24788,"�He is a perfect horror!� screamed the Cactus. �Why, he is twisted and stumpy,",OW

24789,and his head is completely out of proportion with his legs. Really he makes,OW

24790,"me feel prickly all over, and if he comes near me I will sting him with my",OW

24791,thorns.�,OW

24792,"�And he has actually got one of my best blooms,� exclaimed the White RoseTree. �I gave it to the Infanta this morning myself, as a birthday present, and",OW

24793,"he has stolen it from her.� And she called out: �Thief, thief, thief!� at the top of",OW

24794,her voice.,OW

24795,"Even the red Geraniums, who did not usually give themselves airs, and were",OW

24796,"known to have a great many poor relations themselves, curled up in disgust",OW

24797,"when they saw him, and when the Violets meekly remarked that though he",OW

24798,"was certainly extremely plain, still he could not help it, they retorted with a",OW

24799,"good deal of justice that that was his chief defect, and that there was no reason",OW

24800,"why one should admire a person because he was incurable; and, indeed, some",OW

24801,of the Violets themselves felt that the ugliness of the little Dwarf was almost,OW

24802,"ostentatious, and that he would have shown much better taste if he had looked",OW

24803,"sad, or at least pensive, instead of jumping about merrily, and throwing",OW

24804,himself into such grotesque and silly attitudes.,OW

24805,"As for the old Sundial, who was an extremely remarkable individual, and had",OW

24806,once told the time of day to no less a person than the Emperor Charles V.,OW

24807,"himself, he was so taken aback by the little Dwarf�s appearance, that he almost",OW

24808,"forgot to mark two whole minutes with his long shadowy finger, and could not",OW

24809,"help saying to the great milk-white Peacock, who was sunning herself on the",OW

24810,"balustrade, that every one knew that the children of Kings were Kings, and",OW

24811,"that the children of charcoal-burners were charcoal-burners, and that it was",OW

24812,absurd to pretend that it wasn�t so; a statement with which the Peacock,OW

24813,"entirely agreed, and indeed screamed out, �Certainly, certainly,� in such a loud,",OW

24814,"harsh voice, that the gold-fish who lived in the basin of the cool splashing",OW

24815,"fountain put their heads out of the water, and asked the huge stone Tritons",OW

24816,what on earth was the matter.,OW

24817,"But somehow the Birds liked him. They had seen him often in the forest,",OW

24818,"dancing about like an elf after the eddying leaves, or crouched up in the",OW

24819,"hollow of some old oak-tree, sharing his nuts with the squirrels. They did not",OW

24820,"mind his being ugly, a bit. Why, even the nightingale herself, who sang so",OW

24821,sweetly in the orange groves at night that sometimes the Moon leaned down to,OW

24822,"listen, was not much to look at after all; and, besides, he had been kind to",OW

24823,"them, and during that terribly bitter winter, when there were no berries on the",OW

24824,"trees, and the ground was as hard as iron, and the wolves had come down to",OW

24825,"the very gates of the city to look for food, he had never once forgotten them,",OW

24826,"but had always given them crumbs out of his little hunch of black bread, and",OW

24827,divided with them whatever poor breakfast he had.,OW

24828,"So they flew round and round him, just touching his cheek with their wings as",OW

24829,"they passed, and chattered to each other, and the little Dwarf was so pleased",OW

24830,"that he could not help showing them the beautiful white rose, and telling them",OW

24831,that the Infanta herself had given it to him because she loved him.,OW

24832,"They did not understand a single word of what he was saying, but that made",OW

24833,"no matter, for they put their heads on one side, and looked wise, which is quite",OW

24834,"as good as understanding a thing, and very much easier.",OW

24835,"The Lizards also took an immense fancy to him, and when he grew tired of",OW

24836,"running about and flung himself down on the grass to rest, they played and",OW

24837,"romped all over him, and tried to amuse him in the best way they could.",OW

24838,"�Every one cannot be as beautiful as a lizard,� they cried; �that would be too",OW

24839,"much to expect. And, though it sounds absurd to say so, he is really not so",OW

24840,"ugly after all, provided, of course, that one shuts one�s eyes, and does not look",OW

24841,"at him.� The Lizards were extremely philosophical by nature, and often sat",OW

24842,"thinking for hours and hours together, when there was nothing else to do, or",OW

24843,when the weather was too rainy for them to go out.,OW

24844,"The Flowers, however, were excessively annoyed at their behaviour, and at the",OW

24845,"behaviour of the birds. �It only shows,� they said, �what a vulgarising effect",OW

24846,this incessant rushing and flying about has. Well-bred people always stay,OW

24847,"exactly in the same place, as we do. No one ever saw us hopping up and down",OW

24848,"the walks, or galloping madly through the grass after dragon-flies. When we",OW

24849,"do want change of air, we send for the gardener, and he carries us to another",OW

24850,"bed. This is dignified, and as it should be. But birds and lizards have no sense",OW

24851,"of repose, and indeed birds have not even a permanent address. They are mere",OW

24852,"vagrants like the gipsies, and should be treated in exactly the same manner.�",OW

24853,"So they put their noses in the air, and looked very haughty, and were quite",OW

24854,delighted when after some time they saw the little Dwarf scramble up from the,OW

24855,"grass, and make his way across the terrace to the palace.",OW

24856,"�He should certainly be kept indoors for the rest of his natural life,� they said.",OW

24857,"�Look at his hunched back, and his crooked legs,� and they began to titter.",OW

24858,But the little Dwarf knew nothing of all this. He liked the birds and the lizards,OW

24859,"immensely, and thought that the flowers were the most marvellous things in",OW

24860,"the whole world, except of course the Infanta, but then she had given him the",OW

24861,"beautiful white rose, and she loved him, and that made a great difference.",OW

24862,How he wished that he had gone back with her! She would have put him on,OW

24863,"her right hand, and smiled at him, and he would have never left her side, but",OW

24864,"would have made her his playmate, and taught her all kinds of delightful",OW

24865,"tricks. For though he had never been in a palace before, he knew a great many",OW

24866,wonderful things. He could make little cages out of rushes for the,OW

24867,"grasshoppers to sing in, and fashion the long jointed bamboo into the pipe that",OW

24868,"Pan loves to hear. He knew the cry of every bird, and could call the starlings",OW

24869,"from the tree-top, or the heron from the mere. He knew the trail of every",OW

24870,"animal, and could track the hare by its delicate footprints, and the boar by the",OW

24871,"trampled leaves. All the wild-dances he knew, the mad dance in red raiment",OW

24872,"with the autumn, the light dance in blue sandals over the corn, the dance with",OW

24873,"white snow-wreaths in winter, and the blossom-dance through the orchards in",OW

24874,"spring. He knew where the wood-pigeons built their nests, and once when a",OW

24875,"fowler had snared the parent birds, he had brought up the young ones himself,",OW

24876,and had built a little dovecot for them in the cleft of a pollard elm. They were,OW

24877,"quite tame, and used to feed out of his hands every morning. She would like",OW

24878,"them, and the rabbits that scurried about in the long fern, and the jays with",OW

24879,"their steely feathers and black bills, and the hedgehogs that could curl",OW

24880,"themselves up into prickly balls, and the great wise tortoises that crawled",OW

24881,"slowly about, shaking their heads and nibbling at the young leaves. Yes, she",OW

24882,must certainly come to the forest and play with him. He would give her his,OW

24883,"own little bed, and would watch outside the window till dawn, to see that the",OW

24884,"wild horned cattle did not harm her, nor the gaunt wolves creep too near the",OW

24885,"hut. And at dawn he would tap at the shutters and wake her, and they would",OW

24886,go out and dance together all the day long. It was really not a bit lonely in the,OW

24887,"forest. Sometimes a Bishop rode through on his white mule, reading out of a",OW

24888,"painted book. Sometimes in their green velvet caps, and their jerkins of",OW

24889,"tanned deerskin, the falconers passed by, with hooded hawks on their wrists.",OW

24890,"At vintage-time came the grape-treaders, with purple hands and feet, wreathed",OW

24891,with glossy ivy and carrying dripping skins of wine; and the charcoal-burners,OW

24892,"sat round their huge braziers at night, watching the dry logs charring slowly in",OW

24893,"the fire, and roasting chestnuts in the ashes, and the robbers came out of their",OW

24894,"caves and made merry with them. Once, too, he had seen a beautiful",OW

24895,procession winding up the long dusty road to Toledo. The monks went in,OW

24896,"front singing sweetly, and carrying bright banners and crosses of gold, and",OW

24897,"then, in silver armour, with matchlocks and pikes, came the soldiers, and in",OW

24898,"their midst walked three barefooted men, in strange yellow dresses painted all",OW

24899,"over with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in their hands.",OW

24900,"Certainly there was a great deal to look at in the forest, and when she was tired",OW

24901,"he would find a soft bank of moss for her, or carry her in his arms, for he was",OW

24902,"very strong, though he knew that he was not tall. He would make her a",OW

24903,"necklace of red bryony berries, that would be quite as pretty as the white",OW

24904,"berries that she wore on her dress, and when she was tired of them, she could",OW

24905,"throw them away, and he would find her others. He would bring her acorncups and dew-drenched anemones, and tiny glow-worms to be stars in the pale",OW

24906,gold of her hair.,OW

24907,"But where was she? He asked the white rose, and it made him no answer. The",OW

24908,"whole palace seemed asleep, and even where the shutters had not been closed,",OW

24909,heavy curtains had been drawn across the windows to keep out the glare. He,OW

24910,wandered all round looking for some place through which he might gain an,OW

24911,"entrance, and at last he caught sight of a little private door that was lying",OW

24912,"open. He slipped through, and found himself in a splendid hall, far more",OW

24913,"splendid, he feared, than the forest, there was so much more gilding",OW

24914,"everywhere, and even the floor was made of great coloured stones, fitted",OW

24915,"together into a sort of geometrical pattern. But the little Infanta was not there,",OW

24916,only some wonderful white statues that looked down on him from their jasper,OW

24917,"pedestals, with sad blank eyes and strangely smiling lips.",OW

24918,"At the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of black velvet,",OW

24919,"powdered with suns and stars, the King�s favourite devices, and broidered on",OW

24920,the colour he loved best. Perhaps she was hiding behind that? He would try at,OW

24921,any rate.,OW

24922,"So he stole quietly across, and drew it aside. No; there was only another",OW

24923,"room, though a prettier room, he thought, than the one he had just left. The",OW

24924,walls were hung with a many-figured green arras of needle-wrought tapestry,OW

24925,"representing a hunt, the work of some Flemish artists who had spent more than",OW

24926,"seven years in its composition. It had once been the chamber of Jean le Fou,",OW

24927,"as he was called, that mad King who was so enamoured of the chase, that he",OW

24928,"had often tried in his delirium to mount the huge rearing horses, and to drag",OW

24929,"down the stag on which the great hounds were leaping, sounding his hunting",OW

24930,"horn, and stabbing with his dagger at the pale flying deer. It was now used as",OW

24931,"the council-room, and on the centre table were lying the red portfolios of the",OW

24932,"ministers, stamped with the gold tulips of Spain, and with the arms and",OW

24933,emblems of the house of Hapsburg.,OW

24934,"The little Dwarf looked in wonder all round him, and was half-afraid to go on.",OW

24935,The strange silent horsemen that galloped so swiftly through the long glades,OW

24936,"without making any noise, seemed to him like those terrible phantoms of",OW

24937,"whom he had heard the charcoal-burners speaking - the Comprachos, who",OW

24938,"hunt only at night, and if they meet a man, turn him into a hind, and chase",OW

24939,"him. But he thought of the pretty Infanta, and took courage. He wanted to",OW

24940,"find her alone, and to tell her that he too loved her. Perhaps she was in the",OW

24941,room beyond.,OW

24942,"He ran across the soft Moorish carpets, and opened the door. No! She was not",OW

24943,here either. The room was quite empty.,OW

24944,"It was a throne-room, used for the reception of foreign ambassadors, when the",OW

24945,"King, which of late had not been often, consented to give them a personal",OW

24946,"audience; the same room in which, many years before, envoys had appeared",OW

24947,"from England to make arrangements for the marriage of their Queen, then one",OW

24948,"of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe, with the Emperor�s eldest son. The",OW

24949,"hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt chandelier with",OW

24950,branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the black and white,OW

24951,"ceiling. Underneath a great canopy of gold cloth, on which the lions and",OW

24952,"towers of Castile were broidered in seed pearls, stood the throne itself, covered",OW

24953,with a rich pall of black velvet studded with silver tulips and elaborately,OW

24954,fringed with silver and pearls. On the second step of the throne was placed the,OW

24955,"kneeling-stool of the Infanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and",OW

24956,"below that again, and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the",OW

24957,"Papal Nuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King�s presence on",OW

24958,"the occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal�s hat, with its",OW

24959,"tangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple tabouret in front. On the wall, facing",OW

24960,"the throne, hung a life-sized portrait of Charles V. in hunting dress, with a",OW

24961,"great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Philip II. receiving the homage of the",OW

24962,Netherlands occupied the centre of the other wall. Between the windows,OW

24963,"stood a black ebony cabinet, inlaid with plates of ivory, on which the figures",OW

24964,"from Holbein�s Dance of Death had been graved - by the hand, some said, of",OW

24965,that famous master himself.,OW

24966,But the little Dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence. He would not,OW

24967,"have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy, nor one white petal of his",OW

24968,rose for the throne itself. What he wanted was to see the Infanta before she,OW

24969,"went down to the pavilion, and to ask her to come away with him when he had",OW

24970,"finished his dance. Here, in the Palace, the air was close and heavy, but in the",OW

24971,"forest the wind blew free, and the sunlight with wandering hands of gold",OW

24972,"moved the tremulous leaves aside. There were flowers, too, in the forest, not",OW

24973,"so splendid, perhaps, as the flowers in the garden, but more sweetly scented",OW

24974,for all that; hyacinths in early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool,OW

24975,"glens, and grassy knolls; yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round",OW

24976,"the gnarled roots of the oak-trees; bright celandine, and blue speedwell, and",OW

24977,"irises lilac and gold. There were grey catkins on the hazels, and the foxgloves",OW

24978,drooped with the weight of their dappled bee-haunted cells. The chestnut had,OW

24979,"its spires of white stars, and the hawthorn its pallid moons of beauty. Yes:",OW

24980,surely she would come if he could only find her! She would come with him to,OW

24981,"the fair forest, and all day long he would dance for her delight. A smile lit up",OW

24982,"his eyes at the thought, and he passed into the next room.",OW

24983,Of all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful. The walls were,OW

24984,"covered with a pink-flowered Lucca damask, patterned with birds and dotted",OW

24985,"with dainty blossoms of silver; the furniture was of massive silver, festooned",OW

24986,"with florid wreaths, and swinging Cupids; in front of the two large fire-places",OW

24987,"stood great screens broidered with parrots and peacocks, and the floor, which",OW

24988,"was of sea-green onyx, seemed to stretch far away into the distance. Nor was",OW

24989,"he alone. Standing under the shadow of the doorway, at the extreme end of",OW

24990,"the room, he saw a little figure watching him. His heart trembled, a cry of joy",OW

24991,"broke from his lips, and he moved out into the sunlight. As he did so, the",OW

24992,"figure moved out also, and he saw it plainly.",OW

24993,"The Infanta! It was a monster, the most grotesque monster he had ever",OW

24994,"beheld. Not properly shaped, as all other people were, but hunchbacked, and",OW

24995,"crooked-limbed, with huge lolling head and mane of black hair. The little",OW

24996,"Dwarf frowned, and the monster frowned also. He laughed, and it laughed",OW

24997,"with him, and held its hands to its sides, just as he himself was doing. He",OW

24998,"made it a mocking bow, and it returned him a low reverence. He went towards",OW

24999,"it, and it came to meet him, copying each step that he made, and stopping",OW

25000,"when he stopped himself. He shouted with amusement, and ran forward, and",OW

25001,"reached out his hand, and the hand of the monster touched his, and it was as",OW

25002,"cold as ice. He grew afraid, and moved his hand across, and the monster�s",OW

25003,"hand followed it quickly. He tried to press on, but something smooth and hard",OW

25004,"stopped him. The face of the monster was now close to his own, and seemed",OW

25005,"full of terror. He brushed his hair off his eyes. It imitated him. He struck at it,",OW

25006,"and it returned blow for blow. He loathed it, and it made hideous faces at",OW

25007,"him. He drew back, and it retreated.",OW

25008,"What is it? He thought for a moment, and looked round at the rest of the",OW

25009,"room. It was strange, but everything seemed to have its double in this",OW

25010,"invisible wall of clear water. Yes, picture for picture was repeated, and couch",OW

25011,for couch. The sleeping Faun that lay in the alcove by the doorway had its,OW

25012,"twin brother that slumbered, and the silver Venus that stood in the sunlight",OW

25013,held out her arms to a Venus as lovely as herself.,OW

25014,"Was it Echo? He had called to her once in the valley, and she had answered",OW

25015,"him word for word. Could she mock the eye, as she mocked the voice? Could",OW

25016,she make a mimic world just like the real world? Could the shadows of things,OW

25017,have colour and life and movement? Could it be that - ?,OW

25018,"He started, and taking from his breast the beautiful white rose, he turned",OW

25019,"round, and kissed it. The monster had a rose of its own, petal for petal the",OW

25020,"same! It kissed it with like kisses, and pressed it to its heart with horrible",OW

25021,gestures.,OW

25022,"When the truth dawned upon him, he gave a wild cry of despair, and fell",OW

25023,"sobbing to the ground. So it was he who was misshapen and hunchbacked,",OW

25024,"foul to look at and grotesque. He himself was the monster, and it was at him",OW

25025,"that all the children had been laughing, and the little Princess who he had",OW

25026,"thought loved him - she too had been merely mocking at his ugliness, and",OW

25027,"making merry over his twisted limbs. Why had they not left him in the forest,",OW

25028,where there was no mirror to tell him how loathsome he was? Why had his,OW

25029,"father not killed him, rather than sell him to his shame? The hot tears poured",OW

25030,"down his cheeks, and he tore the white rose to pieces. The sprawling monster",OW

25031,"did the same, and scattered the faint petals in the air. It grovelled on the",OW

25032,"ground, and, when he looked at it, it watched him with a face drawn with",OW

25033,"pain. He crept away, lest he should see it, and covered his eyes with his",OW

25034,"hands. He crawled, like some wounded thing, into the shadow, and lay there",OW

25035,moaning.,OW

25036,And at that moment the Infanta herself came in with her companions through,OW

25037,"the open window, and when they saw the ugly little dwarf lying on the ground",OW

25038,"and beating the floor with his clenched hands, in the most fantastic and",OW

25039,"exaggerated manner, they went off into shouts of happy laughter, and stood all",OW

25040,round him and watched him.,OW

25041,"�His dancing was funny,� said the Infanta; �but his acting is funnier still.",OW

25042,"Indeed he is almost as good as the puppets, only of course not quite so",OW

25043,"natural.� And she fluttered her big fan, and applauded.",OW

25044,"But the little Dwarf never looked up, and his sobs grew fainter and fainter, and",OW

25045,"suddenly he gave a curious gasp, and clutched his side. And then he fell back",OW

25046,"again, and lay quite still.",OW

25047,"�That is capital,� said the Infanta, after a pause; �but now you must dance for",OW

25048,me.�,OW

25049,"�Yes,� cried all the children, �you must get up and dance, for you are as clever",OW

25050,"as the Barbary apes, and much more ridiculous.� But the little Dwarf made no",OW

25051,answer.,OW

25052,"And the Infanta stamped her foot, and called out to her uncle, who was",OW

25053,"walking on the terrace with the Chamberlain, reading some despatches that",OW

25054,"had just arrived from Mexico, where the Holy Office had recently been",OW

25055,"established. �My funny little dwarf is sulking,� she cried, �you must wake him",OW

25056,"up, and tell him to dance for me.�",OW

25057,"They smiled at each other, and sauntered in, and Don Pedro stooped down,",OW

25058,and slapped the Dwarf on the cheek with his embroidered glove. �You must,OW

25059,"dance,� he said, �petit monsire. You must dance. The Infanta of Spain and the",OW

25060,Indies wishes to be amused.�,OW

25061,But the little Dwarf never moved.,OW

25062,"�A whipping master should be sent for,� said Don Pedro wearily, and he went",OW

25063,"back to the terrace. But the Chamberlain looked grave, and he knelt beside the",OW

25064,"little dwarf, and put his hand upon his heart. And after a few moments he",OW

25065,"shrugged his shoulders, and rose up, and having made a low bow to the",OW

25066,"Infanta, he said �Mi bella Princesa, your funny little dwarf will never dance again. It is a pity,",OW

25067,for he is so ugly that he might have made the King smile.�,OW

25068,"�But why will he not dance again?� asked the Infanta, laughing.",OW

25069,"�Because his heart is broken,� answered the Chamberlain.",OW

25070,"And the Infanta frowned, and her dainty rose-leaf lips curled in pretty disdain.",OW

25071,"�For the future let those who come to play with me have no hearts,� she cried,",OW

25072,and she ran out into the garden.,OW

25073,THE FISHERMAN AND HIS SOUL,OW

25074,"[TO H.S.H. ALICE, PRINCESS OF MONACO]",OW

25075,"Every evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and threw his nets",OW

25076,into the water.,OW

25077,"When the wind blew from the land he caught nothing, or but little at best, for it",OW

25078,"was a bitter and black-winged wind, and rough waves rose up to meet it. But",OW

25079,"when the wind blew to the shore, the fish came in from the deep, and swam",OW

25080,"into the meshes of his nets, and he took them to the market-place and sold",OW

25081,them.,OW

25082,"Every evening he went out upon the sea, and one evening the net was so heavy",OW

25083,"that hardly could he draw it into the boat. And he laughed, and said to",OW

25084,"himself, �Surely I have caught all the fish that swim, or snared some dull",OW

25085,"monster that will be a marvel to men, or some thing of horror that the great",OW

25086,"Queen will desire,� and putting forth all his strength, he tugged at the coarse",OW

25087,"ropes till, like lines of blue enamel round a vase of bronze, the long veins rose",OW

25088,"up on his arms. He tugged at the thin ropes, and nearer and nearer came the",OW

25089,"circle of flat corks, and the net rose at last to the top of the water.",OW

25090,"But no fish at all was in it, nor any monster or thing of horror, but only a little",OW

25091,Mermaid lying fast asleep.,OW

25092,"Her hair was as a wet fleece of gold, and each separate hair as a thread of fine",OW

25093,"gold in a cup of glass. Her body was as white ivory, and her tail was of silver",OW

25094,"and pearl. Silver and pearl was her tail, and the green weeds of the sea coiled",OW

25095,"round it; and like sea-shells were her ears, and her lips were like sea-coral.",OW

25096,"The cold waves dashed over her cold breasts, and the salt glistened upon her",OW

25097,eyelids.,OW

25098,So beautiful was she that when the young Fisherman saw her he was filled,OW

25099,"with wonder, and he put out his hand and drew the net close to him, and",OW

25100,"leaning over the side he clasped her in his arms. And when he touched her,",OW

25101,"she gave a cry like a startled sea-gull, and woke, and looked at him in terror",OW

25102,"with her mauve-amethyst eyes, and struggled that she might escape. But he",OW

25103,"held her tightly to him, and would not suffer her to depart.",OW

25104,"And when she saw that she could in no way escape from him, she began to",OW

25105,"weep, and said, �I pray thee let me go, for I am the only daughter of a King,",OW

25106,and my father is aged and alone.�,OW

25107,"But the young Fisherman answered, �I will not let thee go save thou makest",OW

25108,"me a promise that whenever I call thee, thou wilt come and sing to me, for the",OW

25109,"fish delight to listen to the song of the Sea-folk, and so shall my nets be full.�",OW

25110,"�Wilt thou in very truth let me go, if I promise thee this?� cried the Mermaid.",OW

25111,"�In very truth I will let thee go,� said the young Fisherman.",OW

25112,"So she made him the promise he desired, and sware it by the oath of the Seafolk. And he loosened his arms from about her, and she sank down into the",OW

25113,"water, trembling with a strange fear.",OW

25114,"Every evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and called to the",OW

25115,"Mermaid, and she rose out of the water and sang to him. Round and round her",OW

25116,"swam the dolphins, and the wild gulls wheeled above her head.",OW

25117,And she sang a marvellous song. For she sang of the Sea-folk who drive their,OW

25118,"flocks from cave to cave, and carry the little calves on their shoulders; of the",OW

25119,"Tritons who have long green beards, and hairy breasts, and blow through",OW

25120,twisted conchs when the King passes by; of the palace of the King which is all,OW

25121,"of amber, with a roof of clear emerald, and a pavement of bright pearl; and of",OW

25122,"the gardens of the sea where the great filigrane fans of coral wave all day long,",OW

25123,"and the fish dart about like silver birds, and the anemones cling to the rocks,",OW

25124,and the pinks bourgeon in the ribbed yellow sand. She sang of the big whales,OW

25125,that come down from the north seas and have sharp icicles hanging to their,OW

25126,fins; of the Sirens who tell of such wonderful things that the merchants have to,OW

25127,"stop their ears with wax lest they should hear them, and leap into the water and",OW

25128,"be drowned; of the sunken galleys with their tall masts, and the frozen sailors",OW

25129,"clinging to the rigging, and the mackerel swimming in and out of the open",OW

25130,"portholes; of the little barnacles who are great travellers, and cling to the keels",OW

25131,of the ships and go round and round the world; and of the cuttlefish who live,OW

25132,"in the sides of the cliffs and stretch out their long black arms, and can make",OW

25133,night come when they will it. She sang of the nautilus who has a boat of her,OW

25134,own that is carved out of an opal and steered with a silken sail; of the happy,OW

25135,Mermen who play upon harps and can charm the great Kraken to sleep; of the,OW

25136,little children who catch hold of the slippery porpoises and ride laughing upon,OW

25137,their backs; of the Mermaids who lie in the white foam and hold out their arms,OW

25138,"to the mariners; and of the sea-lions with their curved tusks, and the sea-horses",OW

25139,with their floating manes.,OW

25140,"And as she sang, all the tunny-fish came in from the deep to listen to her, and",OW

25141,"the young Fisherman threw his nets round them and caught them, and others",OW

25142,"he took with a spear. And when his boat was well-laden, the Mermaid would",OW

25143,"sink down into the sea, smiling at him.",OW

25144,Yet would she never come near him that he might touch her. Oftentimes he,OW

25145,"called to her and prayed of her, but she would not; and when he sought to seize",OW

25146,"her she dived into the water as a seal might dive, nor did he see her again that",OW

25147,day. And each day the sound of her voice became sweeter to his ears. So,OW

25148,"sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his cunning, and had no care of",OW

25149,"his craft. Vermilion-finned and with eyes of bossy gold, the tunnies went by in",OW

25150,"shoals, but he heeded them not. His spear lay by his side unused, and his",OW

25151,"baskets of plaited osier were empty. With lips parted, and eyes dim with",OW

25152,"wonder, he sat idle in his boat and listened, listening till the sea-mists crept",OW

25153,"round him, and the wandering moon stained his brown limbs with silver.",OW

25154,"And one evening he called to her, and said: �Little Mermaid, little Mermaid, I",OW

25155,"love thee. Take me for thy bridegroom, for I love thee.�",OW

25156,"But the Mermaid shook her head. �Thou hast a human soul,� she answered.",OW

25157,"�If only thou wouldst send away thy soul, then could I love thee.�",OW

25158,"And the young Fisherman said to himself, �Of what use is my soul to me? I",OW

25159,cannot see it. I may not touch it. I do not know it. Surely I will send it away,OW

25160,"from me, and much gladness shall be mine.� And a cry of joy broke from his",OW

25161,"lips, and standing up in the painted boat, he held out his arms to the Mermaid.",OW

25162,"�I will send my soul away,� he cried, �and you shall be my bride, and I will be",OW

25163,"thy bridegroom, and in the depth of the sea we will dwell together, and all that",OW

25164,"thou hast sung of thou shalt show me, and all that thou desirest I will do, nor",OW

25165,shall our lives be divided.�,OW

25166,And the little Mermaid laughed for pleasure and hid her face in her hands.,OW

25167,�But how shall I send my soul from me?� cried the young Fisherman. �Tell me,OW

25168,"how I may do it, and lo! it shall be done.�",OW

25169,"�Alas! I know not,� said the little Mermaid: �the Sea-folk have no souls.� And",OW

25170,"she sank down into the deep, looking wistfully at him.",OW

25171,"Now early on the next morning, before the sun was the span of a man�s hand",OW

25172,"above the hill, the young Fisherman went to the house of the Priest and",OW

25173,knocked three times at the door.,OW

25174,"The novice looked out through the wicket, and when he saw who it was, he",OW

25175,"drew back the latch and said to him, �Enter.�",OW

25176,"And the young Fisherman passed in, and knelt down on the sweet-smelling",OW

25177,"rushes of the floor, and cried to the Priest who was reading out of the Holy",OW

25178,"Book and said to him, �Father, I am in love with one of the Sea-folk, and my",OW

25179,soul hindereth me from having my desire. Tell me how I can send my soul,OW

25180,"away from me, for in truth I have no need of it. Of what value is my soul to",OW

25181,me? I cannot see it. I may not touch it. I do not know it.�,OW

25182,"And the Priest beat his breast, and answered, �Alack, alack, thou art mad, or",OW

25183,"hast eaten of some poisonous herb, for the soul is the noblest part of man, and",OW

25184,was given to us by God that we should nobly use it. There is no thing more,OW

25185,"precious than a human soul, nor any earthly thing that can be weighed with it.",OW

25186,"It is worth all the gold that is in the world, and is more precious than the rubies",OW

25187,"of the kings. Therefore, my son, think not any more of this matter, for it is a",OW

25188,"sin that may not be forgiven. And as for the Sea-folk, they are lost, and they",OW

25189,who would traffic with them are lost also. They are as the beasts of the field,OW

25190,"that know not good from evil, and for them the Lord has not died.�",OW

25191,The young Fisherman�s eyes filled with tears when he heard the bitter words,OW

25192,"of the Priest, and he rose up from his knees and said to him, �Father, the Fauns",OW

25193,"live in the forest and are glad, and on the rocks sit the Mermen with their harps",OW

25194,"of red gold. Let me be as they are, I beseech thee, for their days are as the",OW

25195,"days of flowers. And as for my soul, what doth my soul profit me, if it stand",OW

25196,between me and the thing that I love?�,OW

25197,"�The love of the body is vile,� cried the Priest, knitting his brows, �and vile and",OW

25198,evil are the pagan things God suffers to wander through His world. Accursed,OW

25199,"be the Fauns of the woodland, and accursed be the singers of the sea! I have",OW

25200,"heard them at night-time, and they have sought to lure me from my beads.",OW

25201,"They tap at the window, and laugh. They whisper into my ears the tale of their",OW

25202,"perilous joys. They tempt me with temptations, and when I would pray they",OW

25203,"make mouths at me. They are lost, I tell thee, they are lost. For them there is",OW

25204,"no heaven nor hell, and in neither shall they praise God�s name.�",OW

25205,"�Father,� cried the young Fisherman, �thou knowest not what thou sayest.",OW

25206,Once in my net I snared the daughter of a King. She is fairer than the morning,OW

25207,"star, and whiter than the moon. For her body I would give my soul, and for",OW

25208,"her love I would surrender heaven. Tell me what I ask of thee, and let me go",OW

25209,in peace.�,OW

25210,"�Away! Away!� cried the Priest: �thy leman is lost, and thou shalt be lost with",OW

25211,her.�,OW

25212,"And he gave him no blessing, but drove him from his door.",OW

25213,"And the young Fisherman went down into the market-place, and he walked",OW

25214,"slowly, and with bowed head, as one who is in sorrow.",OW

25215,"And when the merchants saw him coming, they began to whisper to each",OW

25216,"other, and one of them came forth to meet him, and called him by name, and",OW

25217,"said to him, �What hast thou to sell?�",OW

25218,"�I will sell thee my soul,� he answered. �I pray thee buy it of me, for I am",OW

25219,weary of it. Of what use is my soul to me? I cannot see it. I may not touch,OW

25220,it. I do not know it.�,OW

25221,"But the merchants mocked at him, and said, �Of what use is a man�s soul to",OW

25222,"us? It is not worth a clipped piece of silver. Sell us thy body for a slave, and",OW

25223,"we will clothe thee in sea-purple, and put a ring upon thy finger, and make",OW

25224,"thee the minion of the great Queen. But talk not of the soul, for to us it is",OW

25225,"nought, nor has it any value for our service.�",OW

25226,And the young Fisherman said to himself: �How strange a thing this is! The,OW

25227,"Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world, and the",OW

25228,merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.� And he passed out,OW

25229,"of the market-place, and went down to the shore of the sea, and began to",OW

25230,ponder on what he should do.,OW

25231,"And at noon he remembered how one of his companions, who was a gatherer",OW

25232,"of samphire, had told him of a certain young Witch who dwelt in a cave at the",OW

25233,"head of the bay and was very cunning in her witcheries. And he set to and ran,",OW

25234,"so eager was he to get rid of his soul, and a cloud of dust followed him as he",OW

25235,sped round the sand of the shore. By the itching of her palm the young Witch,OW

25236,"knew his coming, and she laughed and let down her red hair. With her red hair",OW

25237,"falling around her, she stood at the opening of the cave, and in her hand she",OW

25238,had a spray of wild hemlock that was blossoming.,OW

25239,"�What d�ye lack? What d�ye lack?� she cried, as he came panting up the steep,",OW

25240,"and bent down before her. �Fish for thy net, when the wind is foul? I have a",OW

25241,"little reed-pipe, and when I blow on it the mullet come sailing into the bay.",OW

25242,"But it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price. What d�ye lack? What d�ye lack?",OW

25243,"A storm to wreck the ships, and wash the chests of rich treasure ashore? I",OW

25244,"have more storms than the wind has, for I serve one who is stronger than the",OW

25245,"wind, and with a sieve and a pail of water I can send the great galleys to the",OW

25246,"bottom of the sea. But I have a price, pretty boy, I have a price. What d�ye",OW

25247,"lack? What d�ye lack? I know a flower that grows in the valley, none knows",OW

25248,"it but I. It has purple leaves, and a star in its heart, and its juice is as white as",OW

25249,"milk. Shouldst thou touch with this flower the hard lips of the Queen, she",OW

25250,would follow thee all over the world. Out of the bed of the King she would,OW

25251,"rise, and over the whole world she would follow thee. And it has a price,",OW

25252,"pretty boy, it has a price. What d�ye lack? What d�ye lack? I can pound a",OW

25253,"toad in a mortar, and make broth of it, and stir the broth with a dead man�s",OW

25254,"hand. Sprinkle it on thine enemy while he sleeps, and he will turn into a black",OW

25255,"viper, and his own mother will slay him. With a wheel I can draw the Moon",OW

25256,"from heaven, and in a crystal I can show thee Death. What d�ye lack? What",OW

25257,"d�ye lack? Tell me thy desire, and I will give it thee, and thou shalt pay me a",OW

25258,"price, pretty boy, thou shalt pay me a price.�",OW

25259,"�My desire is but for a little thing,� said the young Fisherman, �yet hath the",OW

25260,"Priest been wroth with me, and driven me forth. It is but for a little thing, and",OW

25261,"the merchants have mocked at me, and denied me. Therefore am I come to",OW

25262,"thee, though men call thee evil, and whatever be thy price I shall pay it.�",OW

25263,"�What wouldst thou?� asked the Witch, coming near to him.",OW

25264,"�I would send my soul away from me,� answered the young Fisherman.",OW

25265,"The Witch grew pale, and shuddered, and hid her face in her blue mantle.",OW

25266,"�Pretty boy, pretty boy,� she muttered, �that is a terrible thing to do.�",OW

25267,"He tossed his brown curls and laughed. �My soul is nought to me,� he",OW

25268,answered. �I cannot see it. I may not touch it. I do not know it.�,OW

25269,"�What wilt thou give me if I tell thee?� asked the Witch, looking down at him",OW

25270,with her beautiful eyes.,OW

25271,"�Five pieces of gold,� he said, �and my nets, and the wattled house where I",OW

25272,"live, and the painted boat in which I sail. Only tell me how to get rid of my",OW

25273,"soul, and I will give thee all that I possess.�",OW

25274,"She laughed mockingly at him, and struck him with the spray of hemlock. �I",OW

25275,"can turn the autumn leaves into gold,� she answered, �and I can weave the pale",OW

25276,moonbeams into silver if I will it. He whom I serve is richer than all the kings,OW

25277,"of this world, and has their dominions.�",OW

25278,"�What then shall I give thee,� he cried, �if thy price be neither gold nor silver?�",OW

25279,The Witch stroked his hair with her thin white hand. �Thou must dance with,OW

25280,"me, pretty boy,� she murmured, and she smiled at him as she spoke.",OW

25281,�Nought but that?� cried the young Fisherman in wonder and he rose to his,OW

25282,feet.,OW

25283,"�Nought but that,� she answered, and she smiled at him again.",OW

25284,"�Then at sunset in some secret place we shall dance together,� he said, �and",OW

25285,after that we have danced thou shalt tell me the thing which I desire to know.�,OW

25286,"She shook her head. �When the moon is full, when the moon is full,� she",OW

25287,"muttered. Then she peered all round, and listened. A blue bird rose screaming",OW

25288,"from its nest and circled over the dunes, and three spotted birds rustled",OW

25289,through the coarse grey grass and whistled to each other. There was no other,OW

25290,sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth pebbles below. So she,OW

25291,"reached out her hand, and drew him near to her and put her dry lips close to",OW

25292,his ear.,OW

25293,"�To-night thou must come to the top of the mountain,� she whispered. �It is a",OW

25294,"Sabbath, and He will be there.�",OW

25295,"The young Fisherman started and looked at her, and she showed her white",OW

25296,teeth and laughed. �Who is He of whom thou speakest?� he asked.,OW

25297,"�It matters not,� she answered.",OW

25298,"�Go thou to-night, and stand under the",OW

25299,"branches of the hornbeam, and wait for my coming. If a black dog run",OW

25300,"towards thee, strike it with a rod of willow, and it will go away. If an owl",OW

25301,"speak to thee, make it no answer. When the moon is full I shall be with thee,",OW

25302,and we will dance together on the grass.�,OW

25303,�But wilt thou swear to me to tell me how I may send my soul from me?� he,OW

25304,made question.,OW

25305,"She moved out into the sunlight, and through her red hair rippled the wind.",OW

25306,"�By the hoofs of the goat I swear it,� she made answer.",OW

25307,"�Thou art the best of the witches,� cried the young Fisherman, �and I will",OW

25308,surely dance with thee to-night on the top of the mountain. I would indeed,OW

25309,that thou hadst asked of me either gold or silver. But such as thy price is thou,OW

25310,"shalt have it, for it is but a little thing.� And he doffed his cap to her, and bent",OW

25311,"his head low, and ran back to the town filled with a great joy.",OW

25312,"And the Witch watched him as he went, and when he had passed from her",OW

25313,"sight she entered her cave, and having taken a mirror from a box of carved",OW

25314,"cedarwood, she set it up on a frame, and burned vervain on lighted charcoal",OW

25315,"before it, and peered through the coils of the smoke. And after a time she",OW

25316,"clenched her hands in anger. �He should have been mine,� she muttered, �I am",OW

25317,as fair as she is.�,OW

25318,"And that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman climbed up",OW

25319,"to the top of the mountain, and stood under the branches of the hornbeam.",OW

25320,"Like a targe of polished metal the round sea lay at his feet, and the shadows of",OW

25321,"the fishing-boats moved in the little bay. A great owl, with yellow sulphurous",OW

25322,"eyes, called to him by his name, but he made it no answer. A black dog ran",OW

25323,"towards him and snarled. He struck it with a rod of willow, and it went away",OW

25324,whining.,OW

25325,At midnight the witches came flying through the air like bats. �Phew!� they,OW

25326,"cried, as they lit upon the ground, �there is some one here we know not!� and",OW

25327,"they sniffed about, and chattered to each other, and made signs. Last of all",OW

25328,"came the young Witch, with her red hair streaming in the wind. She wore a",OW

25329,"dress of gold tissue embroidered with peacocks� eyes, and a little cap of green",OW

25330,velvet was on her head.,OW

25331,"�Where is he, where is he?� shrieked the witches when they saw her, but she",OW

25332,"only laughed, and ran to the hornbeam, and taking the Fisherman by the hand",OW

25333,she led him out into the moonlight and began to dance.,OW

25334,"Round and round they whirled, and the young Witch jumped so high that he",OW

25335,could see the scarlet heels of her shoes. Then right across the dancers came,OW

25336,"the sound of the galloping of a horse, but no horse was to be seen, and he felt",OW

25337,afraid.,OW

25338,"�Faster,� cried the Witch, and she threw her arms about his neck, and her",OW

25339,"breath was hot upon his face. �Faster, faster!� she cried, and the earth seemed",OW

25340,"to spin beneath his feet, and his brain grew troubled, and a great terror fell on",OW

25341,"him, as of some evil thing that was watching him, and at last he became aware",OW

25342,that under the shadow of a rock there was a figure that had not been there,OW

25343,before.,OW

25344,"It was a man dressed in a suit of black velvet, cut in the Spanish fashion. His",OW

25345,"face was strangely pale, but his lips were like a proud red flower. He seemed",OW

25346,"weary, and was leaning back toying in a listless manner with the pommel of",OW

25347,"his dagger. On the grass beside him lay a plumed hat, and a pair of ridinggloves gauntleted with gilt lace, and sewn with seed-pearls wrought into a",OW

25348,"curious device. A short cloak lined with sables hang from his shoulder, and",OW

25349,his delicate white hands were gemmed with rings. Heavy eyelids drooped,OW

25350,over his eyes.,OW

25351,"The young Fisherman watched him, as one snared in a spell. At last their eyes",OW

25352,"met, and wherever he danced it seemed to him that the eyes of the man were",OW

25353,"upon him. He heard the Witch laugh, and caught her by the waist, and whirled",OW

25354,her madly round and round.,OW

25355,"Suddenly a dog bayed in the wood, and the dancers stopped, and going up two",OW

25356,"by two, knelt down, and kissed the man�s hands. As they did so, a little smile",OW

25357,"touched his proud lips, as a bird�s wing touches the water and makes it laugh.",OW

25358,But there was disdain in it. He kept looking at the young Fisherman.,OW

25359,"�Come! let us worship,� whispered the Witch, and she led him up, and a great",OW

25360,"desire to do as she besought him seized on him, and he followed her. But",OW

25361,"when he came close, and without knowing why he did it, he made on his",OW

25362,"breast the sign of the Cross, and called upon the holy name.",OW

25363,No sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks and flew,OW

25364,"away, and the pallid face that had been watching him twitched with a spasm of",OW

25365,"pain. The man went over to a little wood, and whistled. A jennet with silver",OW

25366,trappings came running to meet him. As he leapt upon the saddle he turned,OW

25367,"round, and looked at the young Fisherman sadly.",OW

25368,"And the Witch with the red hair tried to fly away also, but the Fisherman",OW

25369,"caught her by her wrists, and held her fast.",OW

25370,"�Loose me,� she cried, �and let me go. For thou hast named what should not",OW

25371,"be named, and shown the sign that may not be looked at.�",OW

25372,"�Nay,� he answered, �but I will not let thee go till thou hast told me the secret.�",OW

25373,"�What secret?� said the Witch, wrestling with him like a wild cat, and biting",OW

25374,her foam-flecked lips.,OW

25375,"�Thou knowest,� he made answer.",OW

25376,"Her grass-green eyes grew dim with tears, and she said to the Fisherman, �Ask",OW

25377,me anything but that!�,OW

25378,"He laughed, and held her all the more tightly.",OW

25379,"And when she saw that she could not free herself, she whispered to him,",OW

25380,"�Surely I am as fair as the daughters of the sea, and as comely as those that",OW

25381,"dwell in the blue waters,� and she fawned on him and put her face close to his.",OW

25382,"But he thrust her back frowning, and said to her, �If thou keepest not the",OW

25383,promise that thou madest to me I will slay thee for a false witch.�,OW

25384,"She grew grey as a blossom of the Judas tree, and shuddered. �Be it so,� she",OW

25385,muttered. �It is thy soul and not mine. Do with it as thou wilt.� And she took,OW

25386,"from her girdle a little knife that had a handle of green viper�s skin, and gave it",OW

25387,to him.,OW

25388,"�What shall this serve me?� he asked of her, wondering.",OW

25389,"She was silent for a few moments, and a look of terror came over her face.",OW

25390,"Then she brushed her hair back from her forehead, and smiling strangely she",OW

25391,"said to him, �What men call the shadow of the body is not the shadow of the",OW

25392,"body, but is the body of the soul. Stand on the sea-shore with thy back to the",OW

25393,"moon, and cut away from around thy feet thy shadow, which is thy soul�s",OW

25394,"body, and bid thy soul leave thee, and it will do so.�",OW

25395,The young Fisherman trembled. �Is this true?� he murmured.,OW

25396,"�It is true, and I would that I had not told thee of it,� she cried, and she clung to",OW

25397,his knees weeping.,OW

25398,"He put her from him and left her in the rank grass, and going to the edge of the",OW

25399,mountain he placed the knife in his belt and began to climb down.,OW

25400,"And his Soul that was within him called out to him and said, �Lo! I have",OW

25401,"dwelt with thee for all these years, and have been thy servant. Send me not",OW

25402,"away from thee now, for what evil have I done thee?�",OW

25403,"And the young Fisherman laughed. �Thou hast done me no evil, but I have no",OW

25404,"need of thee,� he answered. �The world is wide, and there is Heaven also, and",OW

25405,"Hell, and that dim twilight house that lies between. Go wherever thou wilt,",OW

25406,"but trouble me not, for my love is calling to me.�",OW

25407,"And his Soul besought him piteously, but he heeded it not, but leapt from crag",OW

25408,"to crag, being sure-footed as a wild goat, and at last he reached the level",OW

25409,ground and the yellow shore of the sea.,OW

25410,"Bronze-limbed and well-knit, like a statue wrought by a Grecian, he stood on",OW

25411,"the sand with his back to the moon, and out of the foam came white arms that",OW

25412,"beckoned to him, and out of the waves rose dim forms that did him homage.",OW

25413,"Before him lay his shadow, which was the body of his soul, and behind him",OW

25414,hung the moon in the honey-coloured air.,OW

25415,"And his Soul said to him, �If indeed thou must drive me from thee, send me",OW

25416,"not forth without a heart. The world is cruel, give me thy heart to take with",OW

25417,me.�,OW

25418,He tossed his head and smiled. �With what should I love my love if I gave,OW

25419,thee my heart?� he cried.,OW

25420,"�Nay, but be merciful,� said his Soul: �give me thy heart, for the world is very",OW

25421,"cruel, and I am afraid.�",OW

25422,"�My heart is my love�s,� he answered, �therefore tarry not, but get thee gone.�",OW

25423,�Should I not love also?� asked his Soul.,OW

25424,"�Get thee gone, for I have no need of thee,� cried the young Fisherman, and he",OW

25425,"took the little knife with its handle of green viper�s skin, and cut away his",OW

25426,"shadow from around his feet, and it rose up and stood before him, and looked",OW

25427,"at him, and it was even as himself.",OW

25428,"He crept back, and thrust the knife into his belt, and a feeling of awe came",OW

25429,"over him. �Get thee gone,� he murmured, �and let me see thy face no more.�",OW

25430,"�Nay, but we must meet again,� said the Soul. Its voice was low and flute-like,",OW

25431,and its lips hardly moved while it spake.,OW

25432,�How shall we meet?� cried the young Fisherman. �Thou wilt not follow me,OW

25433,into the depths of the sea?�,OW

25434,"�Once every year I will come to this place, and call to thee,� said the Soul. �It",OW

25435,may be that thou wilt have need of me.�,OW

25436,"�What need should I have of thee?� cried the young Fisherman, �but be it as",OW

25437,"thou wilt,� and he plunged into the waters and the Tritons blew their horns and",OW

25438,"the little Mermaid rose up to meet him, and put her arms around his neck and",OW

25439,kissed him on the mouth.,OW

25440,And the Soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them. And when they,OW

25441,"had sunk down into the sea, it went weeping away over the marshes.",OW

25442,And after a year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the sea and,OW

25443,"called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep, and said, �Why",OW

25444,dost thou call to me?�,OW

25445,"And the Soul answered, �Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have",OW

25446,seen marvellous things.�,OW

25447,"So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head",OW

25448,upon his hand and listened.,OW

25449,"And the Soul said to him, �When I left thee I turned my face to the East and",OW

25450,journeyed. From the East cometh everything that is wise. Six days I,OW

25451,"journeyed, and on the morning of the seventh day I came to a hill that is in the",OW

25452,country of the Tartars. I sat down under the shade of a tamarisk tree to shelter,OW

25453,myself from the sun. The land was dry and burnt up with the heat. The,OW

25454,people went to and fro over the plain like flies crawling upon a disk of,OW

25455,polished copper.,OW

25456,�When it was noon a cloud of red dust rose up from the flat rim of the land.,OW

25457,"When the Tartars saw it, they strung their painted bows, and having leapt upon",OW

25458,their little horses they galloped to meet it. The women fled screaming to the,OW

25459,"waggons, and hid themselves behind the felt curtains.",OW

25460,"�At twilight the Tartars returned, but five of them were missing, and of those",OW

25461,that came back not a few had been wounded. They harnessed their horses to,OW

25462,the waggons and drove hastily away. Three jackals came out of a cave and,OW

25463,"peered after them. Then they sniffed up the air with their nostrils, and trotted",OW

25464,off in the opposite direction.,OW

25465,"�When the moon rose I saw a camp-fire burning on the plain, and went",OW

25466,towards it. A company of merchants were seated round it on carpets. Their,OW

25467,"camels were picketed behind them, and the negroes who were their servants",OW

25468,"were pitching tents of tanned skin upon the sand, and making a high wall of",OW

25469,the prickly pear.,OW

25470,"�As I came near them, the chief of the merchants rose up and drew his sword,",OW

25471,and asked me my business.,OW

25472,"�I answered that I was a Prince in my own land, and that I had escaped from",OW

25473,"the Tartars, who had sought to make me their slave. The chief smiled, and",OW

25474,showed me five heads fixed upon long reeds of bamboo.,OW

25475,"�Then he asked me who was the prophet of God, and I answered him",OW

25476,Mohammed.,OW

25477,"�When he heard the name of the false prophet, he bowed and took me by the",OW

25478,"hand, and placed me by his side. A negro brought me some mare�s milk in a",OW

25479,"wooden dish, and a piece of lamb�s flesh roasted.",OW

25480,�At daybreak we started on our journey. I rode on a red-haired camel by the,OW

25481,"side of the chief, and a runner ran before us carrying a spear. The men of war",OW

25482,"were on either hand, and the mules followed with the merchandise. There",OW

25483,"were forty camels in the caravan, and the mules were twice forty in number.",OW

25484,�We went from the country of the Tartars into the country of those who curse,OW

25485,"the Moon. We saw the Gryphons guarding their gold on the white rocks, and",OW

25486,the scaled Dragons sleeping in their caves. As we passed over the mountains,OW

25487,"we held our breath lest the snows might fall on us, and each man tied a veil of",OW

25488,gauze before his eyes. As we passed through the valleys the Pygmies shot,OW

25489,"arrows at us from the hollows of the trees, and at night-time we heard the wild",OW

25490,men beating on their drums. When we came to the Tower of Apes we set,OW

25491,"fruits before them, and they did not harm us. When we came to the Tower of",OW

25492,"Serpents we gave them warm milk in howls of brass, and they let us go by.",OW

25493,Three times in our journey we came to the banks of the Oxus. We crossed it,OW

25494,on rafts of wood with great bladders of blown hide. The river-horses raged,OW

25495,against us and sought to slay us. When the camels saw them they trembled.,OW

25496,"�The kings of each city levied tolls on us, but would not suffer us to enter their",OW

25497,"gates. They threw us bread over the walls, little maize-cakes baked in honey",OW

25498,and cakes of fine flour filled with dates. For every hundred baskets we gave,OW

25499,them a bead of amber.,OW

25500,"�When the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned the wells and",OW

25501,"fled to the hill-summits. We fought with the Magadae who are born old, and",OW

25502,"grow younger and younger every year, and die when they are little children;",OW

25503,"and with the Laktroi who say that they are the sons of tigers, and paint",OW

25504,themselves yellow and black; and with the Aurantes who bury their dead on,OW

25505,"the tops of trees, and themselves live in dark caverns lest the Sun, who is their",OW

25506,"god, should slay them; and with the Krimnians who worship a crocodile, and",OW

25507,"give it earrings of green glass, and feed it with butter and fresh fowls; and with",OW

25508,"the Agazonbae, who are dog-faced; and with the Sibans, who have horses�",OW

25509,"feet, and run more swiftly than horses. A third of our company died in battle,",OW

25510,"and a third died of want. The rest murmured against me, and said that I had",OW

25511,brought them an evil fortune. I took a horned adder from beneath a stone and,OW

25512,let it sting me. When they saw that I did not sicken they grew afraid.,OW

25513,�In the fourth month we reached the city of Illel. It was night-time when we,OW

25514,"came to the grove that is outside the walls, and the air was sultry, for the Moon",OW

25515,"was travelling in Scorpion. We took the ripe pomegranates from the trees, and",OW

25516,"brake them, and drank their sweet juices. Then we lay down on our carpets,",OW

25517,and waited for the dawn.,OW

25518,�And at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city. It was wrought out,OW

25519,"of red bronze, and carved with sea-dragons and dragons that have wings. The",OW

25520,guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our business. The,OW

25521,interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from the island of Syria,OW

25522,"with much merchandise. They took hostages, and told us that they would",OW

25523,"open the gate to us at noon, and bade us tarry till then.",OW

25524,"�When it was noon they opened the gate, and as we entered in the people came",OW

25525,"crowding out of the houses to look at us, and a crier went round the city crying",OW

25526,"through a shell. We stood in the market-place, and the negroes uncorded the",OW

25527,bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests of sycamore. And when,OW

25528,"they had ended their task, the merchants set forth their strange wares, the",OW

25529,"waxed linen from Egypt and the painted linen from the country of the Ethiops,",OW

25530,"the purple sponges from Tyre and the blue hangings from Sidon, the cups of",OW

25531,cold amber and the fine vessels of glass and the curious vessels of burnt clay.,OW

25532,From the roof of a house a company of women watched us. One of them wore,OW

25533,a mask of gilded leather.,OW

25534,"�And on the first day the priests came and bartered with us, and on the second",OW

25535,"day came the nobles, and on the third day came the craftsmen and the slaves.",OW

25536,And this is their custom with all merchants as long as they tarry in the city.,OW

25537,"�And we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I wearied and",OW

25538,wandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of its,OW

25539,"god. The priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the green trees,",OW

25540,and on a pavement of black marble stood the rose-red house in which the god,OW

25541,"had his dwelling. Its doors were of powdered lacquer, and bulls and peacocks",OW

25542,"were wrought on them in raised and polished gold. The tilted roof was of seagreen porcelain, and the jutting eaves were festooned with little bells. When",OW

25543,"the white doves flew past, they struck the bells with their wings and made",OW

25544,them tinkle.,OW

25545,�In front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx. I lay,OW

25546,"down beside it, and with my pale fingers I touched the broad leaves. One of",OW

25547,"the priests came towards me and stood behind me. He had sandals on his feet,",OW

25548,one of soft serpent-skin and the other of birds� plumage. On his head was a,OW

25549,mitre of black felt decorated with silver crescents. Seven yellows were woven,OW

25550,"into his robe, and his frizzed hair was stained with antimony.",OW

25551,"�After a little while he spake to me, and asked me my desire.",OW

25552,�I told him that my desire was to see the god.,OW

25553,"��The god is hunting,� said the priest, looking strangely at me with his small",OW

25554,slanting eyes.,OW

25555,"��Tell me in what forest, and I will ride with him,� I answered.",OW

25556,�He combed out the soft fringes of his tunic with his long pointed nails. �The,OW

25557,"god is asleep,� he murmured.",OW

25558,"��Tell me on what couch, and I will watch by him,� I answered.",OW

25559,"��The god is at the feast,� he cried.",OW

25560,"��If the wine be sweet I will drink it with him, and if it be bitter I will drink it",OW

25561,"with him also,� was my answer.",OW

25562,"�He bowed his head in wonder, and, taking me by the hand, he raised me up,",OW

25563,and led me into the temple.,OW

25564,�And in the first chamber I saw an idol seated on a throne of jasper bordered,OW

25565,"with great orient pearls. It was carved out of ebony, and in stature was of the",OW

25566,"stature of a man. On its forehead was a ruby, and thick oil dripped from its",OW

25567,"hair on to its thighs. Its feet were red with the blood of a newly-slain kid, and",OW

25568,its loins girt with a copper belt that was studded with seven beryls.,OW

25569,"�And I said to the priest, �Is this the god?� And he answered me, �This is the",OW

25570,god.�,OW

25571,"��Show me the god,� I cried, �or I will surely slay thee.� And I touched his",OW

25572,"hand, and it became withered.",OW

25573,"�And the priest besought me, saying, �Let my lord heal his servant, and I will",OW

25574,show him the god.�,OW

25575,"�So I breathed with my breath upon his hand, and it became whole again, and",OW

25576,"he trembled and led me into the second chamber, and I saw an idol standing on",OW

25577,"a lotus of jade hung with great emeralds. It was carved out of ivory, and in",OW

25578,"stature was twice the stature of a man. On its forehead was a chrysolite, and",OW

25579,its breasts were smeared with myrrh and cinnamon. In one hand it held a,OW

25580,"crooked sceptre of jade, and in the other a round crystal. It ware buskins of",OW

25581,"brass, and its thick neck was circled with a circle of selenites.",OW

25582,"�And I said to the priest, �Is this the god?�",OW

25583,"�And he answered me, �This is the god.�",OW

25584,"��Show me the god,� I cried, �or I will surely slay thee.� And I touched his",OW

25585,"eyes, and they became blind.",OW

25586,"�And the priest besought me, saying, �Let my lord heal his servant, and I will",OW

25587,show him the god.�,OW

25588,"�So I breathed with my breath upon his eyes, and the sight came back to them,",OW

25589,"and he trembled again, and led me into the third chamber, and lo! there was no",OW

25590,"idol in it, nor image of any kind, but only a mirror of round metal set on an",OW

25591,altar of stone.,OW

25592,"�And I said to the priest, �Where is the god?�",OW

25593,"�And he answered me: �There is no god but this mirror that thou seest, for this",OW

25594,is the Mirror of Wisdom. And it reflecteth all things that are in heaven and on,OW

25595,"earth, save only the face of him who looketh into it. This it reflecteth not, so",OW

25596,"that he who looketh into it may be wise. Many other mirrors are there, but",OW

25597,they are mirrors of Opinion. This only is the Mirror of Wisdom. And they,OW

25598,"who possess this mirror know everything, nor is there anything hidden from",OW

25599,"them. And they who possess it not have not Wisdom. Therefore is it the god,",OW

25600,"and we worship it.� And I looked into the mirror, and it was even as he had",OW

25601,said to me.,OW

25602,"�And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a valley that is but",OW

25603,a day�s journey from this place have I hidden the Mirror of Wisdom. Do but,OW

25604,"suffer me to enter into thee again and be thy servant, and thou shalt be wiser",OW

25605,"than all the wise men, and Wisdom shall be thine. Suffer me to enter into thee,",OW

25606,and none will be as wise as thou.�,OW

25607,"But the young Fisherman laughed. �Love is better than Wisdom,� he cried,",OW

25608,�and the little Mermaid loves me.�,OW

25609,"�Nay, but there is nothing better than Wisdom,� said the Soul.",OW

25610,"�Love is better,� answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the deep,",OW

25611,and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.,OW

25612,"And after the second year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of the",OW

25613,"sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep and said,",OW

25614,�Why dost thou call to me?�,OW

25615,"And the Soul answered, �Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have",OW

25616,seen marvellous things.�,OW

25617,"So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head",OW

25618,upon his hand and listened.,OW

25619,"And the Soul said to him, �When I left thee, I turned my face to the South and",OW

25620,journeyed. From the South cometh everything that is precious. Six days I,OW

25621,"journeyed along the highways that lead to the city of Ashter, along the dusty",OW

25622,"red-dyed highways by which the pilgrims are wont to go did I journey, and on",OW

25623,"the morning of the seventh day I lifted up my eyes, and lo! the city lay at my",OW

25624,"feet, for it is in a valley.",OW

25625,"�There are nine gates to this city, and in front of each gate stands a bronze",OW

25626,horse that neighs when the Bedouins come down from the mountains. The,OW

25627,"walls are cased with copper, and the watch-towers on the walls are roofed with",OW

25628,brass. In every tower stands an archer with a bow in his hand. At sunrise he,OW

25629,"strikes with an arrow on a gong, and at sunset he blows through a horn of",OW

25630,horn.,OW

25631,"�When I sought to enter, the guards stopped me and asked of me who I was. I",OW

25632,"made answer that I was a Dervish and on my way to the city of Mecca, where",OW

25633,there was a green veil on which the Koran was embroidered in silver letters by,OW

25634,"the hands of the angels. They were filled with wonder, and entreated me to",OW

25635,pass in.,OW

25636,�Inside it is even as a bazaar. Surely thou shouldst have been with me. Across,OW

25637,the narrow streets the gay lanterns of paper flutter like large butterflies. When,OW

25638,the wind blows over the roofs they rise and fall as painted bubbles do. In front,OW

25639,of their booths sit the merchants on silken carpets. They have straight black,OW

25640,"beards, and their turbans are covered with golden sequins, and long strings of",OW

25641,amber and carved peach-stones glide through their cool fingers. Some of them,OW

25642,"sell galbanum and nard, and curious perfumes from the islands of the Indian",OW

25643,"Sea, and the thick oil of red roses, and myrrh and little nail-shaped cloves.",OW

25644,"When one stops to speak to them, they throw pinches of frankincense upon a",OW

25645,charcoal brazier and make the air sweet. I saw a Syrian who held in his hands,OW

25646,"a thin rod like a reed. Grey threads of smoke came from it, and its odour as it",OW

25647,burned was as the odour of the pink almond in spring. Others sell silver,OW

25648,"bracelets embossed all over with creamy blue turquoise stones, and anklets of",OW

25649,"brass wire fringed with little pearls, and tigers� claws set in gold, and the claws",OW

25650,"of that gilt cat, the leopard, set in gold also, and earrings of pierced emerald,",OW

25651,and finger-rings of hollowed jade. From the tea-houses comes the sound of,OW

25652,"the guitar, and the opium-smokers with their white smiling faces look out at",OW

25653,the passers-by.,OW

25654,�Of a truth thou shouldst have been with me. The wine-sellers elbow their,OW

25655,way through the crowd with great black skins on their shoulders. Most of,OW

25656,"them sell the wine of Schiraz, which is as sweet as honey. They serve it in",OW

25657,little metal cups and strew rose leaves upon it. In the market-place stand the,OW

25658,"fruitsellers, who sell all kinds of fruit: ripe figs, with their bruised purple flesh,",OW

25659,"melons, smelling of musk and yellow as topazes, citrons and rose-apples and",OW

25660,"clusters of white grapes, round red-gold oranges, and oval lemons of green",OW

25661,gold. Once I saw an elephant go by. Its trunk was painted with vermilion and,OW

25662,"turmeric, and over its ears it had a net of crimson silk cord. It stopped",OW

25663,"opposite one of the booths and began eating the oranges, and the man only",OW

25664,laughed. Thou canst not think how strange a people they are. When they are,OW

25665,"glad they go to the bird-sellers and buy of them a caged bird, and set it free",OW

25666,"that their joy may be greater, and when they are sad they scourge themselves",OW

25667,with thorns that their sorrow may not grow less.,OW

25668,�One evening I met some negroes carrying a heavy palanquin through the,OW

25669,"bazaar. It was made of gilded bamboo, and the poles were of vermilion",OW

25670,lacquer studded with brass peacocks. Across the windows hung thin curtains,OW

25671,"of muslin embroidered with beetles� wings and with tiny seed-pearls, and as it",OW

25672,passed by a pale-faced Circassian looked out and smiled at me. I followed,OW

25673,"behind, and the negroes hurried their steps and scowled. But I did not care. I",OW

25674,felt a great curiosity come over me.,OW

25675,"�At last they stopped at a square white house. There were no windows to it,",OW

25676,only a little door like the door of a tomb. They set down the palanquin and,OW

25677,knocked three times with a copper hammer. An Armenian in a caftan of green,OW

25678,"leather peered through the wicket, and when he saw them he opened, and",OW

25679,"spread a carpet on the ground, and the woman stepped out. As she went in,",OW

25680,she turned round and smiled at me again. I had never seen any one so pale.,OW

25681,"�When the moon rose I returned to the same place and sought for the house,",OW

25682,"but it was no longer there. When I saw that, I knew who the woman was, and",OW

25683,wherefore she had smiled at me.,OW

25684,�Certainly thou shouldst have been with me. On the feast of the New Moon,OW

25685,the young Emperor came forth from his palace and went into the mosque to,OW

25686,"pray. His hair and beard were dyed with rose-leaves, and his cheeks were",OW

25687,powdered with a fine gold dust. The palms of his feet and hands were yellow,OW

25688,with saffron.,OW

25689,"�At sunrise he went forth from his palace in a robe of silver, and at sunset he",OW

25690,returned to it again in a robe of gold. The people flung themselves on the,OW

25691,"ground and hid their faces, but I would not do so. I stood by the stall of a",OW

25692,"seller of dates and waited. When the Emperor saw me, he raised his painted",OW

25693,"eyebrows and stopped. I stood quite still, and made him no obeisance. The",OW

25694,"people marvelled at my boldness, and counselled me to flee from the city. I",OW

25695,"paid no heed to them, but went and sat with the sellers of strange gods, who by",OW

25696,"reason of their craft are abominated. When I told them what I had done, each",OW

25697,of them gave me a god and prayed me to leave them.,OW

25698,"�That night, as I lay on a cushion in the tea-house that is in the Street of",OW

25699,"Pomegranates, the guards of the Emperor entered and led me to the palace. As",OW

25700,"I went in they closed each door behind me, and put a chain across it. Inside",OW

25701,was a great court with an arcade running all round. The walls were of white,OW

25702,"alabaster, set here and there with blue and green tiles. The pillars were of",OW

25703,"green marble, and the pavement of a kind of peach-blossom marble. I had",OW

25704,never seen anything like it before.,OW

25705,�As I passed across the court two veiled women looked down from a balcony,OW

25706,"and cursed me. The guards hastened on, and the butts of the lances rang upon",OW

25707,"the polished floor. They opened a gate of wrought ivory, and I found myself",OW

25708,in a watered garden of seven terraces. It was planted with tulip-cups and,OW

25709,"moonflowers, and silver-studded aloes. Like a slim reed of crystal a fountain",OW

25710,hung in the dusky air. The cypress-trees were like burnt-out torches. From,OW

25711,one of them a nightingale was singing.,OW

25712,�At the end of the garden stood a little pavilion. As we approached it two,OW

25713,"eunuchs came out to meet us. Their fat bodies swayed as they walked, and",OW

25714,they glanced curiously at me with their yellow-lidded eyes. One of them drew,OW

25715,"aside the captain of the guard, and in a low voice whispered to him. The other",OW

25716,"kept munching scented pastilles, which he took with an affected gesture out of",OW

25717,an oval box of lilac enamel.,OW

25718,�After a few moments the captain of the guard dismissed the soldiers. They,OW

25719,"went back to the palace, the eunuchs following slowly behind and plucking the",OW

25720,sweet mulberries from the trees as they passed. Once the elder of the two,OW

25721,"turned round, and smiled at me with an evil smile.",OW

25722,�Then the captain of the guard motioned me towards the entrance of the,OW

25723,"pavilion. I walked on without trembling, and drawing the heavy curtain aside",OW

25724,I entered in.,OW

25725,"�The young Emperor was stretched on a couch of dyed lion skins, and a",OW

25726,"gerfalcon perched upon his wrist. Behind him stood a brass-turbaned Nubian,",OW

25727,"naked down to the waist, and with heavy earrings in his split ears. On a table",OW

25728,by the side of the couch lay a mighty scimitar of steel.,OW

25729,"�When the Emperor saw me he frowned, and said to me, �What is thy name?",OW

25730,Knowest thou not that I am Emperor of this city?� But I made him no answer.,OW

25731,"�He pointed with his finger at the scimitar, and the Nubian seized it, and",OW

25732,rushing forward struck at me with great violence. The blade whizzed through,OW

25733,"me, and did me no hurt. The man fell sprawling on the floor, and when he",OW

25734,rose up his teeth chattered with terror and he hid himself behind the couch.,OW

25735,"�The Emperor leapt to his feet, and taking a lance from a stand of arms, he",OW

25736,"threw it at me. I caught it in its flight, and brake the shaft into two pieces. He",OW

25737,"shot at me with an arrow, but I held up my hands and it stopped in mid-air.",OW

25738,"Then he drew a dagger from a belt of white leather, and stabbed the Nubian in",OW

25739,the throat lest the slave should tell of his dishonour. The man writhed like a,OW

25740,"trampled snake, and a red foam bubbled from his lips.",OW

25741,"�As soon as he was dead the Emperor turned to me, and when he had wiped",OW

25742,away the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled and purple,OW

25743,"silk, he said to me, �Art thou a prophet, that I may not harm thee, or the son of",OW

25744,"a prophet, that I can do thee no hurt? I pray thee leave my city to-night, for",OW

25745,while thou art in it I am no longer its lord.�,OW

25746,"�And I answered him, �I will go for half of thy treasure. Give me half of thy",OW

25747,"treasure, and I will go away.�",OW

25748,"�He took me by the hand, and led me out into the garden. When the captain of",OW

25749,"the guard saw me, he wondered. When the eunuchs saw me, their knees shook",OW

25750,and they fell upon the ground in fear.,OW

25751,"�There is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry, and a",OW

25752,brass-sealed ceiling hung with lamps. The Emperor touched one of the walls,OW

25753,"and it opened, and we passed down a corridor that was lit with many torches.",OW

25754,In niches upon each side stood great wine-jars filled to the brim with silver,OW

25755,pieces. When we reached the centre of the corridor the Emperor spake the,OW

25756,"word that may not be spoken, and a granite door swung back on a secret",OW

25757,"spring, and he put his hands before his face lest his eyes should be dazzled.",OW

25758,�Thou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was. There were huge,OW

25759,"tortoise-shells full of pearls, and hollowed moonstones of great size piled up",OW

25760,"with red rubies. The gold was stored in coffers of elephant-hide, and the golddust in leather bottles. There were opals and sapphires, the former in cups of",OW

25761,"crystal, and the latter in cups of jade. Round green emeralds were ranged in",OW

25762,"order upon thin plates of ivory, and in one corner were silk bags filled, some",OW

25763,"with turquoise-stones, and others with beryls. The ivory horns were heaped",OW

25764,"with purple amethysts, and the horns of brass with chalcedonies and sards.",OW

25765,"The pillars, which were of cedar, were hung with strings of yellow lynxstones. In the flat oval shields there were carbuncles, both wine-coloured and",OW

25766,coloured like grass. And yet I have told thee but a tithe of what was there.,OW

25767,�And when the Emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he said,OW

25768,"to me: �This is my house of treasure, and half that is in it is thine, even as I",OW

25769,"promised to thee. And I will give thee camels and camel drivers, and they",OW

25770,shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure to whatever part of the,OW

25771,"world thou desirest to go. And the thing shall be done to-night, for I would",OW

25772,"not that the Sun, who is my father, should see that there is in my city a man",OW

25773,whom I cannot slay.�,OW

25774,"�But I answered him, �The gold that is here is thine, and the silver also is",OW

25775,"thine, and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price. As for me, I",OW

25776,have no need of these. Nor shall I take aught from thee but that little ring that,OW

25777,thou wearest on the finger of thy hand.�,OW

25778,"�And the Emperor frowned. �It is but a ring of lead,� he cried, �nor has it any",OW

25779,value. Therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my city.�,OW

25780,"��Nay,� I answered, �but I will take nought but that leaden ring, for I know",OW

25781,"what is written within it, and for what purpose.�",OW

25782,"�And the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said, �Take all the treasure",OW

25783,and go from my city. The half that is mine shall be thine also.�,OW

25784,"�And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a cave that is but a",OW

25785,"day�s journey from this place have, I hidden the Ring of Riches. It is but a",OW

25786,"day�s journey from this place, and it waits for thy coming. He who has this",OW

25787,"Ring is richer than all the kings of the world. Come therefore and take it, and",OW

25788,the world�s riches shall be thine.�,OW

25789,"But the young Fisherman laughed. �Love is better than Riches,� he cried, �and",OW

25790,the little Mermaid loves me.�,OW

25791,"�Nay, but there is nothing better than Riches,� said the Soul.",OW

25792,"�Love is better,� answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the deep,",OW

25793,and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.,OW

25794,"And after the third year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of the sea,",OW

25795,"and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep and said, �Why",OW

25796,dost thou call to me?�,OW

25797,"And the Soul answered, �Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have",OW

25798,seen marvellous things.�,OW

25799,"So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head",OW

25800,upon his hand and listened.,OW

25801,"And the Soul said to him, �In a city that I know of there is an inn that standeth",OW

25802,"by a river. I sat there with sailors who drank of two different-coloured wines,",OW

25803,"and ate bread made of barley, and little salt fish served in bay leaves with",OW

25804,"vinegar. And as we sat and made merry, there entered to us an old man",OW

25805,bearing a leathern carpet and a lute that had two horns of amber. And when he,OW

25806,"had laid out the carpet on the floor, he struck with a quill on the wire strings of",OW

25807,"his lute, and a girl whose face was veiled ran in and began to dance before us.",OW

25808,"Her face was veiled with a veil of gauze, but her feet were naked. Naked were",OW

25809,"her feet, and they moved over the carpet like little white pigeons. Never have",OW

25810,I seen anything so marvellous; and the city in which she dances is but a day�s,OW

25811,journey from this place.�,OW

25812,"Now when the young Fisherman heard the words of his Soul, he remembered",OW

25813,that the little Mermaid had no feet and could not dance. And a great desire,OW

25814,"came over him, and he said to himself, �It is but a day�s journey, and I can",OW

25815,"return to my love,� and he laughed, and stood up in the shallow water, and",OW

25816,strode towards the shore.,OW

25817,"And when he had reached the dry shore he laughed again, and held out his",OW

25818,"arms to his Soul. And his Soul gave a great cry of joy and ran to meet him,",OW

25819,"and entered into him, and the young Fisherman saw stretched before him upon",OW

25820,the sand that shadow of the body that is the body of the Soul.,OW

25821,"And his Soul said to him, �Let us not tarry, but get hence at once, for the Seagods are jealous, and have monsters that do their bidding.�",OW

25822,"So they made haste, and all that night they journeyed beneath the moon, and",OW

25823,"all the next day they journeyed beneath the sun, and on the evening of the day",OW

25824,they came to a city.,OW

25825,"And the young Fisherman said to his Soul, �Is this the city in which she dances",OW

25826,of whom thou didst speak to me?�,OW

25827,"And his Soul answered him, �It is not this city, but another. Nevertheless let us",OW

25828,"enter in.� So they entered in and passed through the streets, and as they passed",OW

25829,through the Street of the Jewellers the young Fisherman saw a fair silver cup,OW

25830,"set forth in a booth. And his Soul said to him, �Take that silver cup and hide",OW

25831,it.�,OW

25832,"So he took the cup and hid it in the fold of his tunic, and they went hurriedly",OW

25833,out of the city.,OW

25834,"And after that they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman",OW

25835,"frowned, and flung the cup away, and said to his Soul, �Why didst thou tell me",OW

25836,"to take this cup and hide it, for it was an evil thing to do?�",OW

25837,"But his Soul answered him, �Be at peace, be at peace.�",OW

25838,"And on the evening of the second day they came to a city, and the young",OW

25839,"Fisherman said to his Soul, �Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou",OW

25840,didst speak to me?�,OW

25841,"And his Soul answered him, �It is not this city, but another. Nevertheless let us",OW

25842,"enter in.� So they entered in and passed through the streets, and as they passed",OW

25843,"through the Street of the Sellers of Sandals, the young Fisherman saw a child",OW

25844,"standing by a jar of water. And his Soul said to him, �Smite that child.� So he",OW

25845,"smote the child till it wept, and when he had done this they went hurriedly out",OW

25846,of the city.,OW

25847,And after that they had gone a league from the city the young Fisherman grew,OW

25848,"wroth, and said to his Soul, �Why didst thou tell me to smite the child, for it",OW

25849,was an evil thing to do?�,OW

25850,"But his Soul answered him, �Be at peace, be at peace.�",OW

25851,"And on the evening of the third day they came to a city, and the young",OW

25852,"Fisherman said to his Soul, �Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou",OW

25853,didst speak to me?�,OW

25854,"And his Soul answered him, �It may be that it is in this city, therefore let us",OW

25855,enter in.�,OW

25856,"So they entered in and passed through the streets, but nowhere could the",OW

25857,young Fisherman find the river or the inn that stood by its side. And the,OW

25858,"people of the city looked curiously at him, and he grew afraid and said to his",OW

25859,"Soul, �Let us go hence, for she who dances with white feet is not here.�",OW

25860,"But his Soul answered, �Nay, but let us tarry, for the night is dark and there",OW

25861,will be robbers on the way.�,OW

25862,"So he sat him down in the market-place and rested, and after a time there went",OW

25863,"by a hooded merchant who had a cloak of cloth of Tartary, and bare a lantern",OW

25864,"of pierced horn at the end of a jointed reed. And the merchant said to him,",OW

25865,"�Why dost thou sit in the market-place, seeing that the booths are closed and",OW

25866,the bales corded?�,OW

25867,"And the young Fisherman answered him, �I can find no inn in this city, nor",OW

25868,have I any kinsman who might give me shelter.�,OW

25869,�Are we not all kinsmen?� said the merchant. �And did not one God make us?,OW

25870,"Therefore come with me, for I have a guest-chamber.�",OW

25871,So the young Fisherman rose up and followed the merchant to his house. And,OW

25872,when he had passed through a garden of pomegranates and entered into the,OW

25873,"house, the merchant brought him rose-water in a copper dish that he might",OW

25874,"wash his hands, and ripe melons that he might quench his thirst, and set a bowl",OW

25875,of rice and a piece of roasted kid before him.,OW

25876,"And after that he had finished, the merchant led him to the guest-chamber, and",OW

25877,"bade him sleep and be at rest. And the young Fisherman gave him thanks, and",OW

25878,"kissed the ring that was on his hand, and flung himself down on the carpets of",OW

25879,dyed goat�s-hair. And when he had covered himself with a covering of black,OW

25880,lamb�s-wool he fell asleep.,OW

25881,"And three hours before dawn, and while it was still night, his Soul waked him",OW

25882,"and said to him, �Rise up and go to the room of the merchant, even to the room",OW

25883,"in which he sleepeth, and slay him, and take from him his gold, for we have",OW

25884,need of it.�,OW

25885,"And the young Fisherman rose up and crept towards the room of the merchant,",OW

25886,"and over the feet of the merchant there was lying a curved sword, and the tray",OW

25887,by the side of the merchant held nine purses of gold. And he reached out his,OW

25888,"hand and touched the sword, and when he touched it the merchant started and",OW

25889,"awoke, and leaping up seized himself the sword and cried to the young",OW

25890,"Fisherman, �Dost thou return evil for good, and pay with the shedding of",OW

25891,blood for the kindness that I have shown thee?�,OW

25892,"And his Soul said to the young Fisherman, �Strike him,� and he struck him so",OW

25893,"that he swooned and he seized then the nine purses of gold, and fled hastily",OW

25894,"through the garden of pomegranates, and set his face to the star that is the star",OW

25895,of morning.,OW

25896,"And when they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman beat his",OW

25897,"breast, and said to his Soul, �Why didst thou bid me slay the merchant and",OW

25898,take his gold? Surely thou art evil.�,OW

25899,"But his Soul answered him, �Be at peace, be at peace.�",OW

25900,"�Nay,� cried the young Fisherman, �I may not be at peace, for all that thou hast",OW

25901,"made me to do I hate. Thee also I hate, and I bid thee tell me wherefore thou",OW

25902,hast wrought with me in this wise.�,OW

25903,"And his Soul answered him, �When thou didst send me forth into the world",OW

25904,"thou gavest me no heart, so I learned to do all these things and love them.�",OW

25905,�What sayest thou?� murmured the young Fisherman.,OW

25906,"�Thou knowest,� answered his Soul, �thou knowest it well. Hast thou forgotten",OW

25907,"that thou gavest me no heart? I trow not. And so trouble not thyself nor me,",OW

25908,"but be at peace, for there is no pain that thou shalt not give away, nor any",OW

25909,pleasure that thou shalt not receive.�,OW

25910,And when the young Fisherman heard these words he trembled and said to his,OW

25911,"Soul, �Nay, but thou art evil, and hast made me forget my love, and hast",OW

25912,"tempted me with temptations, and hast set my feet in the ways of sin.�",OW

25913,"And his Soul answered him, �Thou hast not forgotten that when thou didst",OW

25914,"send me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart. Come, let us go to",OW

25915,"another city, and make merry, for we have nine purses of gold.�",OW

25916,"But the young Fisherman took the nine purses of gold, and flung them down,",OW

25917,and trampled on them.,OW

25918,"�Nay,� he cried, �but I will have nought to do with thee, nor will I journey with",OW

25919,"thee anywhere, but even as I sent thee away before, so will I send thee away",OW

25920,"now, for thou hast wrought me no good.� And he turned his back to the moon,",OW

25921,and with the little knife that had the handle of green viper�s skin he strove to,OW

25922,cut from his feet that shadow of the body which is the body of the Soul.,OW

25923,"Yet his Soul stirred not from him, nor paid heed to his command, but said to",OW

25924,"him, �The spell that the Witch told thee avails thee no more, for I may not",OW

25925,"leave thee, nor mayest thou drive me forth. Once in his life may a man send",OW

25926,"his Soul away, but he who receiveth back his Soul must keep it with him for",OW

25927,"ever, and this is his punishment and his reward.�",OW

25928,"And the young Fisherman grew pale and clenched his hands and cried, �She",OW

25929,was a false Witch in that she told me not that.�,OW

25930,"�Nay,� answered his Soul, �but she was true to Him she worships, and whose",OW

25931,servant she will be ever.�,OW

25932,And when the young Fisherman knew that he could no longer get rid of his,OW

25933,"Soul, and that it was an evil Soul and would abide with him always, he fell",OW

25934,upon the ground weeping bitterly.,OW

25935,"And when it was day the young Fisherman rose up and said to his Soul, �I will",OW

25936,"bind my hands that I may not do thy bidding, and close my lips that I may not",OW

25937,"speak thy words, and I will return to the place where she whom I love has her",OW

25938,"dwelling. Even to the sea will I return, and to the little bay where she is wont",OW

25939,"to sing, and I will call to her and tell her the evil I have done and the evil thou",OW

25940,hast wrought on me.�,OW

25941,"And his Soul tempted him and said, �Who is thy love, that thou shouldst return",OW

25942,to her? The world has many fairer than she is. There are the dancing-girls of,OW

25943,Samaris who dance in the manner of all kinds of birds and beasts. Their feet,OW

25944,"are painted with henna, and in their hands they have little copper bells. They",OW

25945,"laugh while they dance, and their laughter is as clear as the laughter of water.",OW

25946,Come with me and I will show them to thee. For what is this trouble of thine,OW

25947,about the things of sin? Is that which is pleasant to eat not made for the eater?,OW

25948,"Is there poison in that which is sweet to drink? Trouble not thyself, but come",OW

25949,with me to another city. There is a little city hard by in which there is a garden,OW

25950,of tulip-trees. And there dwell in this comely garden white peacocks and,OW

25951,peacocks that have blue breasts. Their tails when they spread them to the sun,OW

25952,are like disks of ivory and like gilt disks. And she who feeds them dances for,OW

25953,"their pleasure, and sometimes she dances on her hands and at other times she",OW

25954,"dances with her feet. Her eyes are coloured with stibium, and her nostrils are",OW

25955,shaped like the wings of a swallow. From a hook in one of her nostrils hangs a,OW

25956,"flower that is carved out of a pearl. She laughs while she dances, and the",OW

25957,silver rings that are about her ankles tinkle like bells of silver. And so trouble,OW

25958,"not thyself any more, but come with me to this city.�",OW

25959,"But the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but closed his lips with the",OW

25960,"seal of silence and with a tight cord bound his hands, and journeyed back to",OW

25961,"the place from which he had come, even to the little bay where his love had",OW

25962,"been wont to sing. And ever did his Soul tempt him by the way, but he made",OW

25963,"it no answer, nor would he do any of the wickedness that it sought to make",OW

25964,"him to do, so great was the power of the love that was within him.",OW

25965,"And when he had reached the shore of the sea, he loosed the cord from his",OW

25966,"hands, and took the seal of silence from his lips, and called to the little",OW

25967,"Mermaid. But she came not to his call, though he called to her all day long",OW

25968,and besought her.,OW

25969,"And his Soul mocked him and said, �Surely thou hast but little joy out of thy",OW

25970,love. Thou art as one who in time of death pours water into a broken vessel.,OW

25971,"Thou givest away what thou hast, and nought is given to thee in return. It",OW

25972,"were better for thee to come with me, for I know where the Valley of Pleasure",OW

25973,"lies, and what things are wrought there.�",OW

25974,"But the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but in a cleft of the rock he",OW

25975,"built himself a house of wattles, and abode there for the space of a year. And",OW

25976,"every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called to her",OW

25977,"again, and at night-time he spake her name. Yet never did she rise out of the",OW

25978,"sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her though he sought",OW

25979,"for her in the caves and in the green water, in the pools of the tide and in the",OW

25980,wells that are at the bottom of the deep.,OW

25981,"And ever did his Soul tempt him with evil, and whisper of terrible things. Yet",OW

25982,"did it not prevail against him, so great was the power of his love.",OW

25983,"And after the year was over, the Soul thought within himself, �I have tempted",OW

25984,"my master with evil, and his love is stronger than I am. I will tempt him now",OW

25985,"with good, and it may be that he will come with me.�",OW

25986,"So he spake to the young Fisherman and said, �I have told thee of the joy of",OW

25987,"the world, and thou hast turned a deaf ear to me. Suffer me now to tell thee of",OW

25988,"the world�s pain, and it may be that thou wilt hearken. For of a truth pain is",OW

25989,"the Lord of this world, nor is there any one who escapes from its net. There be",OW

25990,"some who lack raiment, and others who lack bread. There be widows who sit",OW

25991,"in purple, and widows who sit in rags. To and fro over the fens go the lepers,",OW

25992,and they are cruel to each other. The beggars go up and down on the,OW

25993,"highways, and their wallets are empty. Through the streets of the cities walks",OW

25994,"Famine, and the Plague sits at their gates. Come, let us go forth and mend",OW

25995,"these things, and make them not to be. Wherefore shouldst thou tarry here",OW

25996,"calling to thy love, seeing she comes not to thy call? And what is love, that",OW

25997,thou shouldst set this high store upon it?�,OW

25998,"But the young Fisherman answered it nought, so great was the power of his",OW

25999,"love. And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called",OW

26000,"to her again, and at night-time he spake her name. Yet never did she rise out",OW

26001,"of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her, though he",OW

26002,"sought for her in the rivers of the sea, and in the valleys that are under the",OW

26003,"waves, in the sea that the night makes purple, and in the sea that the dawn",OW

26004,leaves grey.,OW

26005,"And after the second year was over, the Soul said to the young Fisherman at",OW

26006,"night-time, and as he sat in the wattled house alone, �Lo! now I have tempted",OW

26007,"thee with evil, and I have tempted thee with good, and thy love is stronger",OW

26008,"than I am. Wherefore will I tempt thee no longer, but I pray thee to suffer me",OW

26009,"to enter thy heart, that I may be one with thee even as before.�",OW

26010,"�Surely thou mayest enter,� said the young Fisherman, �for in the days when",OW

26011,with no heart thou didst go through the world thou must have much suffered.�,OW

26012,"�Alas!� cried his Soul, �I can find no place of entrance, so compassed about",OW

26013,with love is this heart of thine.�,OW

26014,"�Yet I would that I could help thee,� said the young Fisherman.",OW

26015,"And as he spake there came a great cry of mourning from the sea, even the cry",OW

26016,that men hear when one of the Sea-folk is dead. And the young Fisherman,OW

26017,"leapt up, and left his wattled house, and ran down to the shore. And the black",OW

26018,"waves came hurrying to the shore, bearing with them a burden that was whiter",OW

26019,"than silver. White as the surf it was, and like a flower it tossed on the waves.",OW

26020,"And the surf took it from the waves, and the foam took it from the surf, and",OW

26021,"the shore received it, and lying at his feet the young Fisherman saw the body",OW

26022,of the little Mermaid. Dead at his feet it was lying.,OW

26023,"Weeping as one smitten with pain he flung himself down beside it, and he",OW

26024,"kissed the cold red of the mouth, and toyed with the wet amber of the hair. He",OW

26025,"flung himself down beside it on the sand, weeping as one trembling with joy,",OW

26026,"and in his brown arms he held it to his breast. Cold were the lips, yet he",OW

26027,"kissed them. Salt was the honey of the hair, yet he tasted it with a bitter joy.",OW

26028,"He kissed the closed eyelids, and the wild spray that lay upon their cups was",OW

26029,less salt than his tears.,OW

26030,And to the dead thing he made confession. Into the shells of its ears he poured,OW

26031,"the harsh wine of his tale. He put the little hands round his neck, and with his",OW

26032,"fingers he touched the thin reed of the throat. Bitter, bitter was his joy, and",OW

26033,full of strange gladness was his pain.,OW

26034,"The black sea came nearer, and the white foam moaned like a leper. With",OW

26035,"white claws of foam the sea grabbled at the shore. From the palace of the SeaKing came the cry of mourning again, and far out upon the sea the great",OW

26036,Tritons blew hoarsely upon their horns.,OW

26037,"�Flee away,� said his Soul, �for ever doth the sea come nigher, and if thou",OW

26038,"tarriest it will slay thee. Flee away, for I am afraid, seeing that thy heart is",OW

26039,closed against me by reason of the greatness of thy love. Flee away to a place,OW

26040,of safety. Surely thou wilt not send me without a heart into another world?�,OW

26041,"But the young Fisherman listened not to his Soul, but called on the little",OW

26042,"Mermaid and said, �Love is better than wisdom, and more precious than",OW

26043,"riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men. The fires cannot",OW

26044,"destroy it, nor can the waters quench it. I called on thee at dawn, and thou",OW

26045,"didst not come to my call. The moon heard thy name, yet hadst thou no heed",OW

26046,"of me. For evilly had I left thee, and to my own hurt had I wandered away.",OW

26047,"Yet ever did thy love abide with me, and ever was it strong, nor did aught",OW

26048,"prevail against it, though I have looked upon evil and looked upon good. And",OW

26049,"now that thou art dead, surely I will die with thee also.�",OW

26050,"And his Soul besought him to depart, but he would not, so great was his love.",OW

26051,"And the sea came nearer, and sought to cover him with its waves, and when he",OW

26052,knew that the end was at hand he kissed with mad lips the cold lips of the,OW

26053,"Mermaid, and the heart that was within him brake. And as through the fulness",OW

26054,"of his love his heart did break, the Soul found an entrance and entered in, and",OW

26055,was one with him even as before. And the sea covered the young Fisherman,OW

26056,with its waves.,OW

26057,"And in the morning the Priest went forth to bless the sea, for it had been",OW

26058,"troubled. And with him went the monks and the musicians, and the candlebearers, and the swingers of censers, and a great company.",OW

26059,And when the Priest reached the shore he saw the young Fisherman lying,OW

26060,"drowned in the surf, and clasped in his arms was the body of the little",OW

26061,"Mermaid. And he drew back frowning, and having made the sign of the cross,",OW

26062,"he cried aloud and said, �I will not bless the sea nor anything that is in it.",OW

26063,"Accursed be the Sea-folk, and accursed be all they who traffic with them. And",OW

26064,"as for him who for love�s sake forsook God, and so lieth here with his leman",OW

26065,"slain by God�s judgment, take up his body and the body of his leman, and bury",OW

26066,"them in the corner of the Field of the Fullers, and set no mark above them, nor",OW

26067,"sign of any kind, that none may know the place of their resting. For accursed",OW

26068,"were they in their lives, and accursed shall they be in their deaths also.�",OW

26069,"And the people did as he commanded them, and in the corner of the Field of",OW

26070,"the Fullers, where no sweet herbs grew, they dug a deep pit, and laid the dead",OW

26071,things within it.,OW

26072,"And when the third year was over, and on a day that was a holy day, the Priest",OW

26073,"went up to the chapel, that he might show to the people the wounds of the",OW

26074,"Lord, and speak to them about the wrath of God.",OW

26075,"And when he had robed himself with his robes, and entered in and bowed",OW

26076,"himself before the altar, he saw that the altar was covered with strange flowers",OW

26077,"that never had been seen before. Strange were they to look at, and of curious",OW

26078,"beauty, and their beauty troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his",OW

26079,"nostrils. And he felt glad, and understood not why he was glad.",OW

26080,"And after that he had opened the tabernacle, and incensed the monstrance that",OW

26081,"was in it, and shown the fair wafer to the people, and hid it again behind the",OW

26082,"veil of veils, he began to speak to the people, desiring to speak to them of the",OW

26083,"wrath of God. But the beauty of the white flowers troubled him, and their",OW

26084,"odour was sweet in his nostrils, and there came another word into his lips, and",OW

26085,"he spake not of the wrath of God, but of the God whose name is Love. And",OW

26086,"why he so spake, he knew not.",OW

26087,"And when he had finished his word the people wept, and the Priest went back",OW

26088,"to the sacristy, and his eyes were full of tears. And the deacons came in and",OW

26089,"began to unrobe him, and took from him the alb and the girdle, the maniple",OW

26090,and the stole. And he stood as one in a dream.,OW

26091,"And after that they had unrobed him, he looked at them and said, �What are",OW

26092,"the flowers that stand on the altar, and whence do they come?�",OW

26093,"And they answered him, �What flowers they are we cannot tell, but they come",OW

26094,"from the corner of the Fullers� Field.� And the Priest trembled, and returned to",OW

26095,his own house and prayed.,OW

26096,"And in the morning, while it was still dawn, he went forth with the monks and",OW

26097,"the musicians, and the candle-bearers and the swingers of censers, and a great",OW

26098,"company, and came to the shore of the sea, and blessed the sea, and all the",OW

26099,"wild things that are in it. The Fauns also he blessed, and the little things that",OW

26100,"dance in the woodland, and the bright-eyed things that peer through the",OW

26101,"leaves. All the things in God�s world he blessed, and the people were filled",OW

26102,with joy and wonder. Yet never again in the corner of the Fullers� Field grew,OW

26103,"flowers of any kind, but the field remained barren even as before. Nor came",OW

26104,"the Sea-folk into the bay as they had been wont to do, for they went to another",OW

26105,part of the sea.,OW

26106,THE STAR-CHILD,OW

26107,[TO MISS MARGOT TENNANT - MRS. ASQUITH],OW

26108,Once upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through,OW

26109,"a great pine-forest. It was winter, and a night of bitter cold. The snow lay",OW

26110,"thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the frost kept",OW

26111,"snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they passed: and when they",OW

26112,"came to the Mountain-Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the IceKing had kissed her.",OW

26113,So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make,OW

26114,of it.,OW

26115,"�Ugh!� snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail",OW

26116,"between his legs, �this is perfectly monstrous weather. Why doesn�t the",OW

26117,Government look to it?�,OW

26118,"�Weet! weet! weet!� twittered the green Linnets, �the old Earth is dead and they",OW

26119,have laid her out in her white shroud.�,OW

26120,"�The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,� whispered the",OW

26121,"Turtle-doves to each other. Their little pink feet were quite frost-bitten, but",OW

26122,they felt that it was their duty to take a romantic view of the situation.,OW

26123,�Nonsense!� growled the Wolf. �I tell you that it is all the fault of the,OW

26124,"Government, and if you don�t believe me I shall eat you.� The Wolf had a",OW

26125,"thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.",OW

26126,"�Well, for my own part,� said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher, �I",OW

26127,"don�t care an atomic theory for explanations. If a thing is so, it is so, and at",OW

26128,present it is terribly cold.�,OW

26129,"Terribly cold it certainly was. The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall firtree, kept rubbing each other�s noses to keep themselves warm, and the",OW

26130,"Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look",OW

26131,out of doors. The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned,OW

26132,"Owls. Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and",OW

26133,"they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the",OW

26134,"forest, �Tu-whit! Tu-whoo! Tu-whit! Tu-whoo! what delightful weather we",OW

26135,are having!�,OW

26136,"On and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers, and",OW

26137,stamping with their huge iron-shod boots upon the caked snow. Once they,OW

26138,"sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones",OW

26139,"are grinding; and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marshwater was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to",OW

26140,pick them up and bind them together again; and once they thought that they,OW

26141,"had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the",OW

26142,Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms. But they put their trust in the,OW

26143,"good Saint Martin, who watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps,",OW

26144,"and went warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw,",OW

26145,"far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they",OW

26146,dwelt.,OW

26147,"So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the",OW

26148,"Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of",OW

26149,gold.,OW

26150,"Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their",OW

26151,"poverty, and one of them said to the other, �Why did we make merry, seeing",OW

26152,"that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are? Better that we had died of",OW

26153,"cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.�",OW

26154,"�Truly,� answered his companion, �much is given to some, and little is given to",OW

26155,"others. Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there equal division of",OW

26156,aught save of sorrow.�,OW

26157,But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing,OW

26158,happened. There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star. It slipped,OW

26159,"down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they",OW

26160,"watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willowtrees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stone�s-throw away.",OW

26161,"�Why! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,� they cried, and they set to",OW

26162,"and ran, so eager were they for the gold.",OW

26163,"And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his",OW

26164,"way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was",OW

26165,"indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow. So he hastened towards it, and",OW

26166,"stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue,",OW

26167,"curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds. And he cried out to",OW

26168,"his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen from the sky, and",OW

26169,"when his comrade had come up, they sat them down in the snow, and loosened",OW

26170,"the folds of the cloak that they might divide the pieces of gold. But, alas! no",OW

26171,"gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little",OW

26172,child who was asleep.,OW

26173,"And one of them said to the other: �This is a bitter ending to our hope, nor",OW

26174,"have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man? Let us leave",OW

26175,"it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have children of our",OW

26176,own whose bread we may not give to another.�,OW

26177,"But his companion answered him: �Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the",OW

26178,"child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have",OW

26179,"many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me,",OW

26180,and my wife shall have care of it.�,OW

26181,"So very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to",OW

26182,"shield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the village, his",OW

26183,comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of heart.,OW

26184,"And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, �Thou hast the",OW

26185,"child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.�",OW

26186,"But he answered him: �Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but the",OW

26187,"child�s only,� and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house and",OW

26188,knocked.,OW

26189,And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned,OW

26190,"safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took from his",OW

26191,"back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots, and bade him",OW

26192,come in.,OW

26193,"But he said to her, �I have found something in the forest, and I have brought it",OW

26194,"to thee to have care of it,� and he stirred not from the threshold.",OW

26195,"�What is it?� she cried. �Show it to me, for the house is bare, and we have",OW

26196,"need of many things.� And he drew the cloak back, and showed her the",OW

26197,sleeping child.,OW

26198,"�Alack, goodman!� she murmured, �have we not children of our own, that thou",OW

26199,must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth? And who knows if it will,OW

26200,not bring us bad fortune? And how shall we tend it?� And she was wroth,OW

26201,against him.,OW

26202,"�Nay, but it is a Star-Child,� he answered; and he told her the strange manner",OW

26203,of the finding of it.,OW

26204,"But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and",OW

26205,"cried: �Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another? Who",OW

26206,is there who careth for us? And who giveth us food?�,OW

26207,"�Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,� he answered.",OW

26208,�Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?� she asked. �And is it not,OW

26209,winter now?�,OW

26210,"And the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold.",OW

26211,"And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made her",OW

26212,"tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: �Wilt thou not close the door?",OW

26213,"There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.�",OW

26214,�Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter wind?� he,OW

26215,"asked. And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to the fire.",OW

26216,"And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of",OW

26217,"tears. And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms, and she kissed",OW

26218,"it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was",OW

26219,lying. And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and,OW

26220,"placed it in a great chest, and a chain of amber that was round the child�s neck",OW

26221,his wife took and set it in the chest also.,OW

26222,"So the Star-Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and sat",OW

26223,"at the same board with them, and was their playmate. And every year he",OW

26224,"became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village",OW

26225,"were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black-haired, he",OW

26226,"was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the",OW

26227,"daffodil. His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower, and his eyes were",OW

26228,"like violets by a river of pure water, and his body like the narcissus of a field",OW

26229,where the mower comes not.,OW

26230,"Yet did his beauty work him evil. For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.",OW

26231,"The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the village, he",OW

26232,"despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he was noble, being",OW

26233,"sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them",OW

26234,"his servants. No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or",OW

26235,"maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them",OW

26236,"forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none",OW

26237,"save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms. Indeed, he was as",OW

26238,"one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill-favoured, and",OW

26239,"make jest of them; and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were",OW

26240,"still, he would lie by the well in the priest�s orchard and look down at the",OW

26241,"marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.",OW

26242,"Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: �We did not deal",OW

26243,"with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to",OW

26244,succour them. Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?�,OW

26245,"Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living",OW

26246,"things, saying to him: �The fly is thy brother. Do it no harm. The wild birds",OW

26247,that roam through the forest have their freedom. Snare them not for thy,OW

26248,"pleasure. God made the blind-worm and the mole, and each has its place.",OW

26249,Who art thou to bring pain into God�s world? Even the cattle of the field,OW

26250,praise Him.�,OW

26251,"But the Star-Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and go",OW

26252,"back to his companions, and lead them. And his companions followed him,",OW

26253,"for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and make music.",OW

26254,"And wherever the Star-Child led them they followed, and whatever the StarChild bade them do, that did they. And when he pierced with a sharp reed the",OW

26255,"dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he cast stones at the leper they",OW

26256,"laughed also. And in all things he ruled them, and they became hard of heart",OW

26257,even as he was.,OW

26258,Now there passed one day through the village a poor beggar-woman. Her,OW

26259,"garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough",OW

26260,"road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight. And being",OW

26261,weary she sat her down under a chestnut-tree to rest.,OW

26262,"But when the Star-Child saw her, he said to his companions, �See! There",OW

26263,"sitteth a foul beggar-woman under that fair and green-leaved tree. Come, let",OW

26264,"us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill-favoured.�",OW

26265,"So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at",OW

26266,"him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him. And when",OW

26267,"the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what the",OW

26268,"Star-Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: �Surely",OW

26269,"thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor",OW

26270,woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?�,OW

26271,"And the Star-Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the",OW

26272,"ground, and said, �Who art thou to question me what I do? I am no son of",OW

26273,thine to do thy bidding.�,OW

26274,"�Thou speakest truly,� answered the Woodcutter, �yet did I show thee pity",OW

26275,when I found thee in the forest.�,OW

26276,"And when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a",OW

26277,"swoon. And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had",OW

26278,"care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen,",OW

26279,"they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.",OW

26280,"But she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter, �Didst thou",OW

26281,not say that the child was found in the forest? And was it not ten years from,OW

26282,this day?�,OW

26283,"And the Woodcutter answered, �Yea, it was in the forest that I found him, and",OW

26284,it is ten years from this day.�,OW

26285,�And what signs didst thou find with him?� she cried. �Bare he not upon his,OW

26286,neck a chain of amber? Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue broidered,OW

26287,with stars?�,OW

26288,"�Truly,� answered the Woodcutter, �it was even as thou sayest.� And he took",OW

26289,"the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and showed them",OW

26290,to her.,OW

26291,"And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, �He is my little son whom",OW

26292,"I lost in the forest. I pray thee send for him quickly, for in search of him have",OW

26293,I wandered over the whole world.�,OW

26294,"So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star-Child, and said",OW

26295,"to him, �Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is",OW

26296,waiting for thee.�,OW

26297,"So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness. But when he saw her who",OW

26298,"was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, �Why, where is my",OW

26299,mother? For I see none here but this vile beggar-woman.�,OW

26300,"And the woman answered him, �I am thy mother.�",OW

26301,"�Thou art mad to say so,� cried the Star-Child angrily. �I am no son of thine,",OW

26302,"for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags. Therefore get thee hence, and let",OW

26303,me see thy foul face no more.�,OW

26304,"�Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,� she cried,",OW

26305,"and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him. �The robbers stole",OW

26306,"thee from me, and left thee to die,� she murmured, �but I recognised thee when",OW

26307,"I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised, the cloak of golden tissue and",OW

26308,"the amber chain. Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole",OW

26309,"world have I wandered in search of thee. Come with me, my son, for I have",OW

26310,need of thy love.�,OW

26311,"But the Star-Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his heart",OW

26312,"against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman",OW

26313,weeping for pain.,OW

26314,"And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter. �If in very truth",OW

26315,"thou art my mother,� he said, �it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and",OW

26316,"not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of",OW

26317,"some Star, and not a beggar�s child, as thou tellest me that I am. Therefore get",OW

26318,"thee hence, and let me see thee no more.�",OW

26319,"�Alas! my son,� she cried, �wilt thou not kiss me before I go? For I have",OW

26320,suffered much to find thee.�,OW

26321,"�Nay,� said the Star-Child, �but thou art too foul to look at, and rather would I",OW

26322,kiss the adder or the toad than thee.�,OW

26323,"So the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and",OW

26324,"when the Star-Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to his",OW

26325,playmates that he might play with them.,OW

26326,"But when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, �Why, thou art",OW

26327,"as foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder. Get thee hence, for we will",OW

26328,"not suffer thee to play with us,� and they drave him out of the garden.",OW

26329,"And the Star-Child frowned and said to himself, �What is this that they say to",OW

26330,"me? I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall tell me of my",OW

26331,beauty.�,OW

26332,"So he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was as the",OW

26333,"face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder. And he flung himself",OW

26334,"down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, �Surely this has come upon",OW

26335,"me by reason of my sin. For I have denied my mother, and driven her away,",OW

26336,"and been proud, and cruel to her. Wherefore I will go and seek her through the",OW

26337,"whole world, nor will I rest till I have found her.�",OW

26338,"And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put her",OW

26339,"hand upon his shoulder and said, �What doth it matter if thou hast lost thy",OW

26340,"comeliness? Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.�",OW

26341,"And he said to her, �Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a",OW

26342,"punishment has this evil been sent to me. Wherefore I must go hence, and",OW

26343,"wander through the world till I find her, and she give me her forgiveness.�",OW

26344,"So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but",OW

26345,"there was no answer. All day long he called to her, and, when the sun set he",OW

26346,"lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves, and the birds and the animals fled from",OW

26347,"him, for they remembered his cruelty, and he was alone save for the toad that",OW

26348,"watched him, and the slow adder that crawled past.",OW

26349,"And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees",OW

26350,"and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely. And",OW

26351,of everything that he met he made inquiry if perchance they had seen his,OW

26352,mother.,OW

26353,"He said to the Mole, �Thou canst go beneath the earth. Tell me, is my mother",OW

26354,there?�,OW

26355,"And the Mole answered, �Thou hast blinded mine eyes. How should I know?�",OW

26356,"He said to the Linnet, �Thou canst fly over the tops of the tall trees, and canst",OW

26357,"see the whole world. Tell me, canst thou see my mother?�",OW

26358,"And the Linnet answered, �Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure. How",OW

26359,should I fly?�,OW

26360,"And to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir-tree, and was lonely, he said,",OW

26361,�Where is my mother?�,OW

26362,"And the Squirrel answered, �Thou hast slain mine. Dost thou seek to slay",OW

26363,thine also?�,OW

26364,"And the Star-Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed forgiveness of God�s",OW

26365,"things, and went on through the forest, seeking for the beggar-woman. And on",OW

26366,the third day he came to the other side of the forest and went down into the,OW

26367,plain.,OW

26368,"And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw",OW

26369,"stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres",OW

26370,"lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and",OW

26371,"their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.",OW

26372,"Nor could he hear anywhere of the beggar-woman who was his mother,",OW

26373,"though for the space of three years he wandered over the world, and often",OW

26374,"seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would call to her, and run",OW

26375,after her till the sharp flints made his feet to bleed. But overtake her he could,OW

26376,"not, and those who dwelt by the way did ever deny that they had seen her, or",OW

26377,"any like to her, and they made sport of his sorrow.",OW

26378,"For the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world",OW

26379,"there was neither love nor loving-kindness nor charity for him, but it was even",OW

26380,such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great pride.,OW

26381,And one evening he came to the gate of a strong-walled city that stood by a,OW

26382,"river, and, weary and footsore though he was, he made to enter in. But the",OW

26383,"soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and",OW

26384,"said roughly to him, �What is thy business in the city?�",OW

26385,"�I am seeking for my mother,� he answered, �and I pray ye to suffer me to pass,",OW

26386,for it may be that she is in this city.�,OW

26387,"But they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set down",OW

26388,"his shield and cried, �Of a truth, thy mother will not be merry when she sees",OW

26389,"thee, for thou art more ill-favoured than the toad of the marsh, or the adder",OW

26390,that crawls in the fen. Get thee gone. Get thee gone. Thy mother dwells not,OW

26391,in this city.�,OW

26392,"And another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him, �Who is thy",OW

26393,"mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?�",OW

26394,"And he answered, �My mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have treated her",OW

26395,"evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her forgiveness,",OW

26396,"if it be that she tarrieth in this city.� But they would not, and pricked him with",OW

26397,their spears.,OW

26398,"And, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt",OW

26399,"flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and",OW

26400,made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance. And they,OW

26401,"said to him, �It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have driven him",OW

26402,away.�,OW

26403,"�Nay,� he cried, laughing, �but we will sell the foul thing for a slave, and his",OW

26404,price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.�,OW

26405,"And an old and evil-visaged man who was passing by called out, and said, �I",OW

26406,"will buy him for that price,� and, when he had paid the price, he took the StarChild by the hand and led him into the city.",OW

26407,And after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little door,OW

26408,that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree. And the old,OW

26409,"man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they",OW

26410,went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and,OW

26411,green jars of burnt clay. And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of,OW

26412,"figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star-Child, and drave him in",OW

26413,"front of him. And when the scarf was taken off his eyes, the Star-Child found",OW

26414,"himself in a dungeon, that was lit by a lantern of horn.",OW

26415,"And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said,",OW

26416,"�Eat,� and some brackish water in a cup and said, �Drink,� and when he had",OW

26417,"eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and",OW

26418,fastening it with an iron chain.,OW

26419,"And on the morrow the old man, who was indeed the subtlest of the magicians",OW

26420,"of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the tombs of the Nile,",OW

26421,"came in to him and frowned at him, and said, �In a wood that is nigh to the",OW

26422,gate of this city of Giaours there are three pieces of gold. One is of white,OW

26423,"gold, and another is of yellow gold, and the gold of the third one is red. Today thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not",OW

26424,"back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes. Get thee away quickly, and at",OW

26425,sunset I will be waiting for thee at the door of the garden. See that thou,OW

26426,"bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I",OW

26427,have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.� And he bound the,OW

26428,"eyes of the Star-Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him through the",OW

26429,"house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five steps of brass. And",OW

26430,having opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street.,OW

26431,"And the Star-Child went out of the gate of the city, and came to the wood of",OW

26432,which the Magician had spoken to him.,OW

26433,"Now this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of",OW

26434,"singing birds and of sweet-scented flowers, and the Star-Child entered it",OW

26435,"gladly. Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars",OW

26436,"and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles",OW

26437,"stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore",OW

26438,distress. Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white gold of which the,OW

26439,"Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn to noon, and from",OW

26440,"noon to sunset. And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly,",OW

26441,for he knew what fate was in store for him.,OW

26442,"But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a",OW

26443,cry as of some one in pain. And forgetting his own sorrow he ran back to the,OW

26444,"place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that some hunter had set for",OW

26445,it.,OW

26446,"And the Star-Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, �I am myself",OW

26447,"but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.�",OW

26448,"And the Hare answered him, and said: �Surely thou hast given me freedom,",OW

26449,and what shall I give thee in return?�,OW

26450,"And the Star-Child said to it, �I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I",OW

26451,"anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.�",OW

26452,"�Come thou with me,� said the Hare, �and I will lead thee to it, for I know",OW

26453,"where it is hidden, and for what purpose.�",OW

26454,"So the Star-Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak-tree he",OW

26455,"saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking. And he was filled with joy,",OW

26456,"and seized it, and said to the Hare, �The service that I did to thee thou hast",OW

26457,"rendered back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee",OW

26458,thou hast repaid a hundred-fold.�,OW

26459,"�Nay,� answered the Hare, �but as thou dealt with me, so I did deal with thee,�",OW

26460,"and it ran away swiftly, and the Star-Child went towards the city.",OW

26461,Now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper. Over his,OW

26462,"face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes gleamed like",OW

26463,"red coals. And when he saw the Star-Child coming, he struck upon a wooden",OW

26464,"bowl, and clattered his bell, and called out to him, and said, �Give me a piece",OW

26465,"of money, or I must die of hunger. For they have thrust me out of the city, and",OW

26466,there is no one who has pity on me.�,OW

26467,"�Alas!� cried the Star-Child, �I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and",OW

26468,"if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.�",OW

26469,"But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star-Child had pity, and",OW

26470,gave him the piece of white gold.,OW

26471,"And when he came to the Magician�s house, the Magician opened to him, and",OW

26472,"brought him in, and said to him, �Hast thou the piece of white gold?� And the",OW

26473,"Star-Child answered, �I have it not.� So the Magician fell upon him, and beat",OW

26474,"him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, �Eat,� and an empty cup,",OW

26475,"and said, �Drink,� and flung him again into the dungeon.",OW

26476,"And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, �If to-day thou",OW

26477,"bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my slave,",OW

26478,and give thee three hundred stripes.�,OW

26479,"So the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece",OW

26480,"of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it. And at sunset he sat him down",OW

26481,"and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare",OW

26482,"that he had rescued from the trap,",OW

26483,"And the Hare said to him, �Why art thou weeping? And what dost thou seek",OW

26484,in the wood?�,OW

26485,"And the Star-Child answered, �I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is",OW

26486,"hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a",OW

26487,slave.�,OW

26488,"�Follow me,� cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to a pool",OW

26489,of water. And at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold was lying.,OW

26490,"�How shall I thank thee?� said the Star-Child, �for lo! this is the second time",OW

26491,that you have succoured me.�,OW

26492,"�Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,� said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.",OW

26493,"And the Star-Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his wallet, and",OW

26494,"hurried to the city. But the leper saw him coming, and ran to meet him, and",OW

26495,"knelt down and cried, �Give me a piece of money or I shall die of hunger.�",OW

26496,"And the Star-Child said to him, �I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow",OW

26497,"gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his",OW

26498,slave.�,OW

26499,"But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star-Child had pity on him, and",OW

26500,gave him the piece of yellow gold.,OW

26501,"And when he came to the Magician�s house, the Magician opened to him, and",OW

26502,"brought him in, and said to him, �Hast thou the piece of yellow gold?� And",OW

26503,"the Star-Child said to him, �I have it not.� So the Magician fell upon him, and",OW

26504,"beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again into the dungeon.",OW

26505,"And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, �If to-day thou",OW

26506,"bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou bringest it not",OW

26507,I will surely slay thee.�,OW

26508,"So the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece",OW

26509,"of red gold, but nowhere could he find it. And at evening he sat him down and",OW

26510,"wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare.",OW

26511,"And the Hare said to him, �The piece of red gold that thou seekest is in the",OW

26512,cavern that is behind thee. Therefore weep no more but be glad.�,OW

26513,"�How shall I reward thee?� cried the Star-Child, �for lo! this is the third time",OW

26514,thou hast succoured me.�,OW

26515,"�Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,� said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.",OW

26516,"And the Star-Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he found the",OW

26517,"piece of red gold. So he put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city. And the",OW

26518,"leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and",OW

26519,"said to him, �Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,� and the StarChild had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, �Thy",OW

26520,"need is greater than mine.� Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate",OW

26521,awaited him.,OW

26522,"But lo! as he passed through the gate of the city, the guards bowed down and",OW

26523,"made obeisance to him, saying, �How beautiful is our lord!� and a crowd of",OW

26524,"citizens followed him, and cried out, �Surely there is none so beautiful in the",OW

26525,"whole world!� so that the Star-Child wept, and said to himself, �They are",OW

26526,"mocking me, and making light of my misery.� And so large was the concourse",OW

26527,"of the people that he lost the threads of his way, and found himself at last in a",OW

26528,"great square, in which there was a palace of a King.",OW

26529,"And the gate of the palace opened, and the priests and the high officers of the",OW

26530,"city ran forth to meet him, and they abased themselves before him, and said,",OW

26531,"�Thou art our lord for whom we have been waiting, and the son of our King.�",OW

26532,"And the Star-Child answered them and said, �I am no king�s son, but the child",OW

26533,"of a poor beggar-woman. And how say ye that I am beautiful, for I know that",OW

26534,I am evil to look at?�,OW

26535,"Then he, whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet",OW

26536,"crouched a lion that had wings, held up a shield, and cried, �How saith my lord",OW

26537,that he is not beautiful?�,OW

26538,"And the Star-Child looked, and lo! his face was even as it had been, and his",OW

26539,"comeliness had come back to him, and he saw that in his eyes which he had",OW

26540,not seen there before.,OW

26541,"And the priests and the high officers knelt down and said to him, �It was",OW

26542,prophesied of old that on this day should come he who was to rule over us.,OW

26543,"Therefore, let our lord take this crown and this sceptre, and be in his justice",OW

26544,and mercy our King over us.�,OW

26545,"But he said to them, �I am not worthy, for I have denied the mother who bare",OW

26546,"me, nor may I rest till I have found her, and known her forgiveness.",OW

26547,"Therefore, let me go, for I must wander again over the world, and may not",OW

26548,"tarry here, though ye bring me the crown and the sceptre.� And as he spake he",OW

26549,"turned his face from them towards the street that led to the gate of the city, and",OW

26550,"lo! Amongst the crowd that pressed round the soldiers, he saw the beggarwoman who was his mother, and at her side stood the leper, who had sat by the",OW

26551,road.,OW

26552,"And a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he ran over, and kneeling down he",OW

26553,"kissed the wounds on his mother�s feet, and wet them with his tears. He",OW

26554,"bowed his head in the dust, and sobbing, as one whose heart might break, he",OW

26555,"said to her: �Mother, I denied thee in the hour of my pride. Accept me in the",OW

26556,"hour of my humility. Mother, I gave thee hatred. Do thou give me love.",OW

26557,"Mother, I rejected thee. Receive thy child now.� But the beggar-woman",OW

26558,answered him not a word.,OW

26559,"And he reached out his hands, and clasped the white feet of the leper, and said",OW

26560,to him: �Thrice did I give thee of my mercy. Bid my mother speak to me,OW

26561,once.� But the leper answered him not a word.,OW

26562,"And he sobbed again and said: �Mother, my suffering is greater than I can",OW

26563,"bear. Give me thy forgiveness, and let me go back to the forest.� And the",OW

26564,"beggar-woman put her hand on his head, and said to him, �Rise,� and the leper",OW

26565,"put his hand on his head, and said to him, �Rise,� also.",OW

26566,"And he rose up from his feet, and looked at them, and lo! they were a King",OW

26567,and a Queen.,OW

26568,"And the Queen said to him, �This is thy father whom thou hast succoured.�",OW

26569,"And the King said, �This is thy mother whose feet thou hast washed with thy",OW

26570,"tears.� And they fell on his neck and kissed him, and brought him into the",OW

26571,"palace and clothed him in fair raiment, and set the crown upon his head, and",OW

26572,"the sceptre in his hand, and over the city that stood by the river he ruled, and",OW

26573,"was its lord. Much justice and mercy did he show to all, and the evil Magician",OW

26574,"he banished, and to the Woodcutter and his wife he sent many rich gifts, and to",OW

26575,their children he gave high honour. Nor would he suffer any to be cruel to,OW

26576,"bird or beast, but taught love and loving-kindness and charity, and to the poor",OW

26577,"he gave bread, and to the naked he gave raiment, and there was peace and",OW

26578,plenty in the land.,OW

26579,"Yet ruled he not long, so great had been his suffering, and so bitter the fire of",OW

26580,"his testing, for after the space of three years he died. And he who came after",OW

26581,him ruled evilly.,OW
